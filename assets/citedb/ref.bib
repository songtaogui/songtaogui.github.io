  abstract = {The breeding system in Nicotiana glauca is unique in that the species comprises mainly self-compatible (S.C.) green-flowered plants but also includes rare self-incompatible (S.I.) red-flowered races. The S.C. plants of Nicotiana glauca show unilateral interspecificincompatibility with other S.I. species of Nicotiana, a widely occurring characteristic normally associated with S.C. species with relatively long-established self-compatibility. The present study of S.I. and S.C. strains of Nicotiana glauca showed that the \$ S.I. x S.C. S type of unilateral incompatibility (U.I.) occurs within this species, and the U.I. is a function of the S alleles. Of the nine S, alleles studied seven, when present in the homozygous state in the style, made that style reject Sc (Nicotiana glauca) pollen whereas two alleles allowed styles to accept this pollen. Similar polymorphism at the Nicotiana glauca S locus was also found in relation to Sf pollen from the S.C. species Nicotiana langsdorffiiS. , alleles in Nicotiana glauca were classified differentlyfor the polymorphisms in relation to Sc and Sf pollen. The results show that the Sc allele is sporophytically determined causing allelic interaction in the pollen and style. Dominance, co-dominance and competitive interaction were observed. In contrast the Sf allele of Nicotiana langsdorffiis gametophytically determined, stylar alleles always showing independent action.},

In double diffusion experiments, no immunoprecipitate was observed when branching enzyme IIa or Ilb was tested against branching enzyme I antiserum. No immunoprecipitate was formed when branching enzyme I was tested against branching enzyme Ila or lib antisenum. Increasing amounts of antisera in the above combinations also failed to inhibit enzyme activity. Branching enzyme IIa antiserum cross-reacted and formed spurs with branching enzyme lIb when compared with branching enzyme hIa antigen. Comparison of branching enzyme IIb antiserum with branching enzyme Ila also resulted in an immunoprecipitate. Increasing levels of branching enzyme IIa antiserum inhibited branching enzyme Ilb as did the reciprocal combination. The data indicated that branching enzymes Ila and Ilb are immunologically similar while branching enzyme I is distinct. The data supports the classification of starch branching enzymes based on genetic, kinetic, and chromatographic properties.},

  abstract = {Aquatic plants are notoriously difficult to study systematically due to convergent evolution and reductionary processes that result in confusing arrays of morphological features. Plant systematists have frequently focused their attention on the "water lilies," putative descendants of the most archaic angiosperms. Classification of these 10 plant genera varies from recognition of one to three orders containing three to six families. We have used DNA sequence analysis as a means of overcoming many problems inherent in morphologically based studies of the group. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data obtained from a 1.2-kilobase portion of the chloroplast gene rbcL provide compelling evidence for the recognition of three distinct lineages of "water lily" plants. Molecular phylogenies including woody Magnoliidae sequences and sequences of these aquatic plants depict Ceratophyllum as an early diverging genus. Our results support hypotheses that most taxonomic concepts of the order Nymphaeales reflect polyphyletic groups and that the unusual genus Ceratophyllum represents descendants of some of the earliest angiosperms.},

  abstract = {The maize gene rab28 has been identified as ABA-inducible in embryos and vegetative tissues. It is also induced by water stress in young leaves. The proximal promoter region contains the conserved cis-acting element CCACGTGG (ABRE) reported for ABA induction in other plant genes. Transient expression assays in rice protoplasts indicate that a 134 bp fragment ( - 194 to -60 containing the ABRE) fused to a truncated cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (35S) is sufficient to confer ABA-responsiveness upon the GUS reporter gene. Gel retardation experiments indicate that nuclear proteins from tissues in which the rab28 gene is expressed can interact specifically with this 134 bp DNA fragment. Nuclear protein extracts from embryo and water-stressed leaves generate specific complexes of different electrophoretic mobility which are stable in the presence of detergent and high salt. However, by DMS footprinting the same guanine-specific contacts with the ABRE in both the embryo and leaf binding activities were detected. These results indicate that the rab28 promoter sequence CCACGTGG is a functional ABAresponsive element, and suggest that distinct regulatory factors with apparent similar affinity for the ABRE sequence may be involved in the hormone action during embryo development and in vegetative tissues subjected to osmotic stress.},

Estimation of sample probabilities is described when the ancestral or derived status of each allele is specified. In addition, probabilities for two-locus diploid samples are provided. A method for using these two-locus probabilities to test whether an observed level of linkage disequilibrium is unusually large or small is described. In addition, properties of a maximum-likelihood estimator of the recombination parameter based on independent linked pairs of sites are obtained. A composite-likelihood estimator, for more than two linked sites, is also examined and found to work as well, or better, than other available ad hoc estimators. Linkage disequilibrium in the Xq28 and Xq25 region of humans is analyzed in a sample of Europeans (CEPH). The estimated recombination parameter is about five times smaller than one would expect under an equilibrium neutral model.},

The lack of evidence for counterbalancing mechanisms that curtail unlimited genome growth has made many of us wonder whether angiosperms have a ``one-way ticket to genomic obesity.'' We have therefore investigated an angiosperm with a well-characterized and notably small genome,               Arabidopsis thaliana               , for evidence of genomic DNA loss. Our results indicate that illegitimate recombination is the driving force behind genome size decrease in               Arabidopsis               , removing at least fivefold more DNA than unequal homologous recombination. The presence of highly degraded retroelements also suggests that retrotransposon amplification has not been confined to the last 4 million years, as is indicated by the dating of intact retroelements.},

Recent findings indicate that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) can occur in blocks of limited haplotypic diversity with high degrees of LD. Commonly used measures for LD, such as r2 and D), consider only two loci and might miss information to appropriately describe LD in larger haplotypic structures. Methods: We introduce the Normalized Entropy Difference, \^A, as a new multilocus measure for LD. A related quantity, \textcent S, provides an approximate \textasciimacron 2 test for the significance of LD. The ability of the measure to detect haplotype blocks is investigated using simulated data sets as well as a real data set previously analyzed by Daly et al. (2001). Results: \^A allows for arbitrary numbers of loci, describes LD with regard to the loci sequence, and can be interpreted as a multilocus extension of r2. The application of \^A to the data sets demonstrated the measure's ability to appropriately describe simultaneous multilocus LD and to detect haplotype blocks. Conclusions: \^A is a reasonable multilocus LD measure and might be of potential use in the construction of the human haplotype map.},

These elements, many highly fragmented, were identified on the basis of sequence homology and structural characteristics. The 11 families, totaling 1000 elements, have copy numbers ranging from 1 to 278. Less than one-quarter of these elements are intact, whereas the remaining are solo LTRs and variously truncated fragments. We also analyzed two highly repetitive families (               Osr8               and               Osr30               ) of LTR retrotransposons and observed the same results. Our data indicate that unequal homologous recombination and illegitimate recombination are primarily responsible for LTR-retrotransposon removal. Further analysis suggests that most of the detectable LTR retrotransposons in rice inserted less than 8 million years ago, and have now lost over two-thirds of their encoded sequences. Hence, we predict that the half-life of LTR-retrotransposon sequences in rice is less than 6 million years. Moreover, our data demonstrate that at least 22\% (97 Mb) of the current rice genome is comprised of LTR-retrotransposon sequences, and that more than 190 Mb of LTR-retrotransposon sequences have been deleted from the rice genome in the last 8 million years.},

Class 1 (retro) elements are the most abundant TE class in both species with LTR and non-LTR elements comprising the largest fraction of each genome. However, several families of class 2 (DNA) elements have amplified to very high copy number in               B. oleracea               where they have contributed significantly to genome expansion. Taken together, the results of this analysis indicate that amplification of both class 1 and class 2 TEs is responsible, in part, for               B. oleracea               genome expansion since divergence from a common ancestor with               A. thaliana               . In addition, the observation that               B. oleracea               and               A. thaliana               share virtually all TE lineages makes it unlikely that wholesale removal of TEs is responsible for the compact genome of               A. thaliana               .},

The alleles contain extended regions of nonhomology. On average, more than 50\% of the compared sequence is noncolinear, mainly because of the insertion of large numbers of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons. Only 27 LTR-retroelements are shared between alleles, whereas 62 are allele specific. The insertion of LTR-retrotransposons into the maize genome is statistically more recent for nonshared than shared ones. Most surprisingly, more than one-third of the genes (27/72) are absent in one of the inbreds at the loci examined. Such nonshared genes usually appear to be truncated and form clusters in which they are oriented in the same direction. However, the nonshared genome segments are gene-poor, relative to regions shared by both inbreds, with up to 12-fold difference in gene density. By contrast, miniature inverted terminal repeats (MITEs) occur at a similar frequency in the shared and nonshared fractions. Many times, MITES are present in an identical position in both LTRs of a retroelement, indicating that their insertion occurred before the replication of the retroelement in question. Maize ESTs and/or maize massively parallel signature sequencing tags were identified for the majority of the nonshared genes or homologs of them. In contrast with shared genes, which are usually conserved in gene order and location relative to rice (Oryza sativa), nonshared genes violate the maize colinearity with rice. Based on this, insertion by a yet unknown mechanism, rather than deletion events, seems to be the origin of the nonshared genes. The intergenic space between conserved genes is enlarged up to sixfold in maize compared with rice. Frequently, retroelement insertions create a different sequence environment adjacent to conserved genes.},

In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of the evolutionary events observed at this locus by comparing corresponding sequences of diploid, tertraploid, and hexaploid wheat species (Triticum and Aegilops). Genomic rearrangements, such as transposable element insertions, genomic deletions, duplications, and inversions, were shown to constitute the major differences when the same genomes (i.e., the A, B, or D genomes) were compared between species of different ploidy levels. The comparative analysis allowed us to determine the extent and sequences of the rearranged regions as well as rearrangement breakpoints and sequence motifs at their boundaries, which suggest rearrangement by illegitimate recombination. Among these genomic rearrangements, the previously reported Pina and Pinb genes loss from the Ha locus of polyploid wheat species was caused by a large genomic deletion that probably occurred independently in the A and B genomes. Moreover, the Ha locus in the D genome of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum) is 29 kb smaller than in the D genome of its diploid progenitor Ae. tauschii, principally because of transposable element insertions and two large deletions caused by illegitimate recombination. Our data suggest that illegitimate DNA recombination, leading to various genomic rearrangements, constitutes one of the major evolutionary mechanisms in wheat species.},

  abstract = {The familiar evolutionary model assumes a tree, a model that has greatly facilitated the discussion and testing of hypotheses. However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly described by such models. Even when evolution proceeds in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served by forcing the data onto a tree or assuming a tree-like model. Rather, visualization and exploration of the data to discover and evaluate its properties can be an essential first step. Recognition of these issues has led to the development of a number of different types of phylogenetic networks (see Fig. 1). In this article we first discuss the terminology used to describe and distinguish between the different types of phylogenetic networks and methods that are currently in use. There are a number of different types of phylogenetic networks, and this can be a source of confusion. We then provide a detailed introduction to split networks, how they are defined, and how they can be interpreted. We discuss the use of split networks in strategies for dealing with systematic error, especially as a preliminary step to tree-based analysis and show examples of a number of different types of networks. We outline the beginnings of a statistical framework for phylogenetic inference using split network methods. Split networks have been widely used as a tool for visualization but have been neglected as a tool for statistical inference. Their success as a tool for visualizing incompatible and ambiguous phylogenetic signals suggests that if they are properly used, they can become an invaluable statistical inference tool for phylogenetics. Here we describe a method for constructing approximate confidence intervals (CIs) for trees using networks and a simple test to determine whether an incompatible signal in a network is statistically significant. There is considerable scope for improvement of both methods.},

  abstract = {Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons constitute a significant portion of most eukaryote genomes and can dramatically change genome size and organization. Although LTR retrotransposon content variation is well documented, the dynamics of genomic flux caused by their activity are poorly understood on an evolutionary time scale. This is primarily because of the lack of an experimental system composed of closely related species whose divergence times are within the limits of the ability to detect ancestrally related retrotransposons. The genus Oryza, with 24 species, ten genome types, different ploidy levels and over threefold genome size variation, constitutes an ideal experimental system to explore genus-level transposon dynamics. Here we present data on the discovery and characterization of an LTR retrotransposon family named RWG in the genus Oryza. Comparative analysis of transposon content (approximately 20 to 27 000 copies) and transpositional history of this family across the genus revealed a broad spectrum of independent and lineage-specific changes that have implications for the evolution of genome size and organization. In particular, we provide evidence that the basal GG genome of Oryza (O. granulata) has expanded by nearly 25\% by a burst of the RWG lineage Gran3 subsequent to speciation. Finally we describe the recent evolutionary origin of Dasheng, a large retrotransposon derivative of the RWG family, specifically found in the A, B and C genome lineages of Oryza.},

In this method, a de Bruijn graph is used to express the input sequences information, which is recorded in the edges of the graph. As a result, a consensus-finding problem can be transformed to a maximum weighted path problem of the graph. MWPAlign obtains almost linear computation speed of the multiple sequences alignment problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible, and for a large number of sequences with mutation rate lower than 5.2\%, MWPALign can obtain better alignment results and has lower computational time as compared to CLUSTALW (cluster alignments weight), T-Coffee and HMMT (hidden Markov model training).},

Because the transposition is a replicative cycle which can eventually produce many copies comprising a large fraction of the plant genome this obviously has profound effects on the evolution of the structure of retrotransposon populations and the overall genome structure of each species.},

We used 20               copia               families from the large-genome plants barley and wheat to identify 46 families of homologous               copia               elements from rice and 22 from               Arabidopsis               , two plant species with much smaller genomes. In total, 599               copia               elements were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that               copia               elements from the four species can be classified into six ancient lineages that existed before the divergence of monocots and dicots. The six lineages show a surprising degree of conservation in sequence organization and other characteristics across species. Additionally, the phylogenetic data suggest at least one case of horizontal gene transfer between the               Arabidopsis               and rice lineages. Insertion time estimates for 522 high-copy elements showed that retrotransposons from rice were active at different times in waves of activity lasting 0.5\textendash 2 million years, depending on the family, whereas elements from wheat and barley had longer periods of activity. We estimated that half of the rice               copia               elements are truncated or otherwise rearranged after {$\sim$}790,000 yr, which is almost twice the half-life of               Arabidopsis               elements. In contrast, wheat and barley               copia               elements appear to have a massively longer half-life, beyond our ability to estimate from the available data. These findings suggest that genome size can be explained by the specific rate of DNA removal from the genome and the length of active periods of retrotransposon families.},

The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS.1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},

The increasing availability of genome data has led to several in silico studies of microsatellite evolution which have produced a vast range of algorithms and software for tandem repeat detection. Documentation of these tools is often sparse, or provided in a format that is impenetrable to most biologists without informatics background. This article introduces the major concepts behind repeat detecting software essential for informed tool selection. We reflect on issues such as parameter settings and program bias, as well as redundancy filtering and efficiency using examples from the currently available range of programs, to provide an integrated comparison and practical guide to microsatellite detecting programs.},

Recently, inverse normal transformations (INTs) have gained popularity among genetics researchers and are implemented as an option in several software packages. Despite this increasing use, we are unaware of extensive simulations or mathematical proofs showing that INTs have desirable statistical properties in the context of genetic studies. We show that INTs do not necessarily maintain proper Type 1 error control and can also reduce statistical power in some circumstances. Many alternatives to INTs exist. Therefore, we contend that there is a lack of justification for performing parametric statistical procedures on INTs with the exceptions of simple designs with moderate to large sample sizes, which makes permutation testing computationally infeasible and where maximum likelihood testing is used. Rigorous research evaluating the utility of INTs seems warranted.},

The repeated evolution of similar traits in organisms facing similar environmental conditions is a pervasive phenomenon, including for animal morphology, and is considered a strong evidence for adaptive evolution. Examples of repeated evolution of particular traits offer a unique opportunity to ask whether evolution has followed similar or different genetic paths. Case studies reveal that although multiple genetic paths were often possible to evolve a morphological trait, similar evolutionary trajectories have been followed repeatedly in independent lineages, suggesting that biases influence the course of genetic evolution. In the light of these examples we examine several factors influencing the genetic paths of adaptive evolution and in particular how the interplay between natural selection and genetic variations carves out predictable genetic trajectories of morphological evolution.},

In the following years, various kinds of methods were developed to test whether natural selection has ever happened. With the improvement of DNA sequencing technologies, large amount of DNA sequence polymorphism data is available, providing a mass of materials for testing the natural selection theory. Since natural selection would leave its footprint on the genome, we are able to refer the adaptive evolutionary history of a population. On the other hand, population demographic history and other evolutionary forces may affect DNA polymorphic pattern in similar way, which may interfere with tests. In this paper, we summarized some basic concepts of neutral test, and briefly introduced some classical methods. Focus was given to several recently developed methods.},

  abstract = {Using bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (16.9 Mb) and high-quality alignments of genomic sequences (17.4 Mb), we performed a global assessment of the divergence distributions, phylogenies, and consensus sequences for               Alu               elements in primates including lemur, marmoset, macaque, baboon, and chimpanzee as compared to human. We found that in lemurs,               Alu               elements show a broader and more symmetric sequence divergence distribution, suggesting a steady rate of               Alu               retrotransposition activity among prosimians. In contrast,               Alu               elements in anthropoids show a skewed distribution shifted toward more ancient elements with continual declining rates in recent               Alu               activity along the hominoid lineage of evolution. Using an integrated approach combining mutation profile and insertion/deletion analyses, we identified nine novel lineage-specific               Alu               subfamilies in lemur (seven), marmoset (one), and baboon/macaque (one) containing multiple diagnostic mutations distinct from their human counterparts\textemdash{}               Alu               J, S, and Y subfamilies, respectively. Among these primates, we show that that the lemur has the lowest density of               Alu               repeats (55 repeats/Mb), while marmoset has the greatest abundance (188 repeats/Mb). We estimate that {$\sim$}70\% of lemur and 16\% of marmoset               Alu               elements belong to lineage-specific subfamilies. Our analysis has provided an evolutionary framework for further classification and refinement of the               Alu               repeat phylogeny. The differences in the distribution and rates of               Alu               activity have played an important role in subtly reshaping the structure of primate genomes. The functional consequences of these changes among the diverse primate lineages over such short periods of evolutionary time are an important area of future investigation.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION             A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment (msa) of proteins. In the model, each column of symbols in the alignment is represented by a frequency distribution of the symbols (called a ``state''), and insertions and deletions are represented by other states. One moves through the model along a particular path from state to state in a Markov chain (i.e., random choice of next move), trying to match a given sequence. The next matching symbol is chosen from each state, recording its probability (frequency) and also the probability of going to that state from a previous one (the transition probability). State and transition probabilities are multiplied to obtain a probability of the given sequence. The hidden nature of the HMM is due to the lack of information about the value of a specific state, which is instead represented by a probability distribution over all possible values. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of HMMs in msa and presents algorithms for calculating an HMM and the conditions for producing the best HMM.},

Whole-genome, array-based, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a level of structural diversity between the inbred lines B73 and Mo17 that is unprecedented among higher eukaryotes. A detailed analysis of altered segments of DNA conservatively estimates that there are several hundred CNV sequences among the two genotypes, as well as several thousand PAV sequences that are present in B73 but not Mo17. Haplotype-specific PAVs contain hundreds of single-copy, expressed genes that may contribute to heterosis and to the extraordinary phenotypic diversity of this important crop.},

We have compared the distributions and functions of Z-DNA in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice, and observed that Z-DNA occurs in rice at least 9 times more often than in Arabidopsis; similar observations hold for other monocots and dicots. In addition, Z-DNA is significantly enriched in the coding regions of Arabidopsis, and in the high-GC-content regions of rice. Based on our analyses, we speculate that ZDNA may play a role in regulating the expression of transcription factors, inhibitors, translation repressors, succinate dehydrogenases and glutathione-disulfide reductases in Arabidopsis, and it may affect the expression of vesicle and nucleosome genes and genes involved in alcohol transporter activity, stem cell maintenance, meristem development and reproductive structure development in rice.},

We present a likelihood method for detecting selective sweeps that involves jointly modeling the multilocus allele frequency differentiation between two populations. We use Brownian motion to model genetic drift under neutrality, and a deterministic model to approximate the effect of a selective sweep on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity. We test the method with extensive simulated data, and demonstrate that in some scenarios the method provides higher power than previously reported approaches to detect selective sweeps, and can provide surprisingly good localization of the position of a selected allele. A strength of our technique is that it uses allele frequency differentiation between populations, which is much more robust to ascertainment bias in SNP discovery than methods based on the allele frequency spectrum. We apply this method to compare continentally diverse populations, as well as Northern and Southern Europeans. Our analysis identifies a list of loci as candidate targets of selection, including well-known selected loci and new regions that have not been highlighted by previous scans for selection.},

  abstract = {Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic fossils of ancient retroviral integrations that remain in the genome of many organisms. Most loci are rendered non-functional by mutations, but several intact retroviral genes are known in mammalian genomes. Some have been adopted by the host species, while the beneficial roles of others remain unclear. Besides the obvious possible immunogenic impact from transcribing intact viral genes, endogenous retroviruses have also become an interesting and useful tool to study phylogenetic relationships. The determination of the integration time of these viruses has been based upon the assumption that both 59 and 39 Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) sequences are identical at the time of integration, but evolve separately afterwards. Similar approaches have been using either a constant evolutionary rate or a range of rates for these viral loci, and only single species data. Here we show the advantages of using different approaches. Results: We show that there are strong advantages in using multiple species data and state-of-the-art phylogenetic analysis. We incorporate both simple phylogenetic information and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to date the integrations of these viruses based on a relaxed molecular clock approach over a Bayesian phylogeny model and applied them to several selected ERV sequences in primates. These methods treat each ERV locus as having a distinct evolutionary rate for each LTR, and make use of consensual speciation time intervals between primates to calibrate the relaxed molecular clocks. Conclusions: The use of a fixed rate produces results that vary considerably with ERV family and the actual evolutionary rate of the sequence, and should be avoided whenever multi-species phylogenetic data are available. For genome-wide studies, the simple phylogenetic approach constitutes a better alternative, while still being computationally feasible.},

  abstract = {It is an assumption of large, population-based datasets that samples are annotated accurately whether they correspond to known relationships or unrelated individuals. These annotations are key for a broad range of genetics applications. While many methods are available to assess relatedness that involve estimates of identity-by-descent (IBD) and/or identity-bystate (IBS) allele-sharing proportions, we developed a novel approach that estimates IBD0, 1, and 2 based on observed IBS within windows. When combined with genome-wide IBS information, it provides an intuitive and practical graphical approach with the capacity to analyze datasets with thousands of samples without prior information about relatedness between individuals or haplotypes. We applied the method to a commonly used Human Variation Panel consisting of 400 nominally unrelated individuals. Surprisingly, we identified identical, parent-child, and full-sibling relationships and reconstructed pedigrees. In two instances non-sibling pairs of individuals in these pedigrees had unexpected IBD2 levels, as well as multiple regions of homozygosity, implying inbreeding. This combined method allowed us to distinguish related individuals from those having atypical heterozygosity rates and determine which individuals were outliers with respect to their designated population. Additionally, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify distant relatedness using genomewide IBS methods alone. However, our IBD method further identified distant relatedness between individuals within populations, supported by the presence of megabase-scale regions lacking IBS0 across individual chromosomes. We benchmarked our approach against the hidden Markov model of a leading software package (PLINK), showing improved calling of distantly related individuals, and we validated it using a known pedigree from a clinical study. The application of this approach could improve genome-wide association, linkage, heterozygosity, and other population genomics studies that rely on SNP genotype data.},

  abstract = {Complex diseases are often highly heritable. However, for many complex traits only a small proportion of the heritability can be explained by observed genetic variants in traditional genome-wide association (GWA) studies. Moreover, for some of those traits few significant SNPs have been identified. Single SNP association methods test for association at a single SNP, ignoring the effect of other SNPs. We show using a simple multi-locus odds model of complex disease that moderate to large effect sizes of causal variants may be estimated as relatively small effect sizes in single SNP association testing. This underestimation effect is most severe for diseases influenced by numerous risk variants. We relate the underestimation effect to the concept of non-collapsibility found in the statistics literature. As described, continuous phenotypes generated with linear genetic models are not affected by this underestimation effect. Since many GWA studies apply single SNP analysis to dichotomous phenotypes, previously reported results potentially underestimate true effect sizes, thereby impeding identification of true effect SNPs. Therefore, when a multi-locus model of disease risk is assumed, a multi SNP analysis may be more appropriate.},

  abstract = {Background: The generation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a crucial step for many bioinformatic analyses. Thus improving MSA accuracy and identifying potential errors in MSAs is important for a wide range of post-genomic research. We present a novel method called MergeAlign which constructs consensus MSAs from multiple independent MSAs and assigns an alignment precision score to each column. Results: Using conventional benchmark tests we demonstrate that on average MergeAlign MSAs are more accurate than MSAs generated using any single matrix of sequence substitution. We show that MergeAlign column scores are related to alignment precision and hence provide an ab initio method of estimating alignment precision in the absence of curated reference MSAs. Using two novel and independent alignment performance tests that utilise a large set of orthologous gene families we demonstrate that increasing MSA performance leads to an increase in the performance of downstream phylogenetic analyses. Conclusion: Using multiple tests of alignment performance we demonstrate that this novel method has broad general application in biological research.},

  abstract = {When groups of related bacterial genomes are compared, the number of core genes found in all genomes is usually much less than the mean genome size, whereas the size of the pangenome (the set of genes found on at least one of the genomes) is much larger than the mean size of one genome. We analyze 172 complete genomes of Bacilli and compare the properties of the pangenomes and core genomes of monophyletic subsets taken from this group. We then assess the capabilities of several evolutionary models to predict these properties. The infinitely many genes (IMG) model is based on the assumption that each new gene can arise only once. The predictions of the model depend on the shape of the evolutionary tree that underlies the divergence of the genomes. We calculate results for coalescent trees, star trees, and arbitrary phylogenetic trees of predefined fixed branch length. On a star tree, the pangenome size increases linearly with the number of genomes, as has been suggested in some previous studies, whereas on a coalescent tree, it increases logarithmically. The coalescent tree gives a better fit to the data, for all the examples we consider. In some cases, a fixed phylogenetic tree proved better than the coalescent tree at reproducing structure in the gene frequency spectrum, but little improvement was gained in predictions of the core and pangenome sizes. Most of the data are well explained by a model with three classes of gene: an essential class that is found in all genomes, a slow class whose rate of origination and deletion is slow compared with the time of divergence of the genomes, and a fast class showing rapid origination and deletion. Although the majority of genes originating in a genome are in the fast class, these genes are not retained for long periods, and the majority of genes present in a genome are in the slow or essential classes. In general, we show that the IMG model is useful for comparison with experimental genome data both for species level and widely divergent taxonomic groups.

Gene silencing showed that genes in a 31-kilobase segment at               rhg1-b               , encoding an amino acid transporter, an {$\alpha$}-SNAP protein, and a WI12 (wound-inducible domain) protein, each contribute to resistance. There is one copy of the 31-kilobase segment per haploid genome in susceptible varieties, but 10 tandem copies are present in an               rhg1-b               haplotype. Overexpression of the individual genes in roots was ineffective, but overexpression of the genes together conferred enhanced SCN resistance. Hence, SCN resistance mediated by the soybean quantitative trait locus               Rhg1               is conferred by copy number variation that increases the expression of a set of dissimilar genes in a repeated multigene segment.                        ,                             Soybean crops, which supply valuable protein, oil, and renewable fuel, are under attack by a nematode for which there is no effective pesticide. Instead, agriculture relies on resistance derived from a genetic locus, which is now represented in most of the soybean crops cultivated in the United States.                                Cook                 et al.                              (p.               1206               , published online 11 October) elucidated the mechanisms by which this               rhg1-b               allele protects against disease. The region carries several genes, none of which resemble other known immune receptor genes. Experiments silencing one or another of the genes showed that the genes work as a cluster. However, one set of the genes is not enough: Plants need multiple repeats of the locus to acquire resistance.},

  abstract = {Natural selection often produces convergent changes in unrelated lineages, but the degree to which such adaptations occur via predictable genetic paths is unknown. If only a limited subset of possible mutations is fixed in independent lineages, then it is clear that constraint in the production or function of molecular variants is an important determinant of adaptation. We demonstrate remarkably constrained convergence during the evolution of resistance to the lethal poison, tetrodotoxin, in six snake species representing three distinct lineages from around the globe. Resistance-conferring amino acid substitutions in a voltage-gated sodium channel, Na               v               1.4, are clustered in only two regions of the protein, and a majority of the replacements are confined to the same three positions. The observed changes represent only a small fraction of the experimentally validated mutations known to increase Na               v               1.4 resistance to tetrodotoxin. These results suggest that constraints resulting from functional tradeoffs between ion channel function and toxin resistance led to predictable patterns of evolutionary convergence at the molecular level. Our data are consistent with theoretical predictions and recent microcosm work that suggest a predictable path is followed during an adaptive walk along a mutational landscape, and that natural selection may be frequently constrained to produce similar genetic outcomes even when operating on independent lineages.},

The prediction of genomic breeding values usually requires that missing genotypes be imputed because a proportion of genotypes is usually uncalled by the genotyping algorithm, different individuals may be genotyped using different platforms, or low cost genotyping strategies can involve genotyping some individuals at high density and others at low density. The objective of this paper was to quantify the accuracy of imputation in a maize (Zea mays L.) data set and explore some of the factors that affect it. The factors studied were the density of the low-density platform, level of linkage disequilibrium, minor allele frequency of the marker being imputed, and degree of genetic relationship between the line being imputed and the training population. The accuracy of imputation was high even when only 8774 genotypes constitute the low-density platform. The correlation between the true and imputed genotypes was 0.87. However, there was a dramatic reduction in the accuracy of imputation when the low-density platforms had fewer than 8774 genotypes. Genetic relatedness between an individual having its genotypes imputed and the individuals genotyped with the high-density platform was important. The design of an information nucleus that incorporates imputation for the purposes of implementing genomic selection and association mapping in small independent breeding programs was discussed.},

In this study, we performed microarray analyses using the three species, and compared characteristics of identified coldand dehydration-inducible genes. Transcription profiles of the cold- and dehydration-responsive genes were similar among these three species, showing representative upregulated (dehydrin/LEA) and downregulated ( photosynthesis-related) genes. All (46 5 4096) hexamer sequences in the promoters of the three species were investigated, revealing the frequency of conserved sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters. A core sequence of the abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE) was the most conserved in dehydration-inducible promoters of all three species, suggesting that transcriptional regulation for dehydration-inducible genes is similar among these three species, with the ABRE-dependent transcriptional pathway. In contrast, for cold-inducible promoters, the conserved hexamer sequences were diversified among these three species, suggesting the existence of diverse transcriptional regulatory pathways for cold-inducible genes among the species.},

However, several regions exhibited both copy number and presence-absence variation, the most prominent found on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 16, and 18. Interestingly, the regions most enriched for SV were specifically localized to gene-rich regions that harbor clustered multigene families. The most abundant classes of gene families associated with these regions were the nucleotide-binding and receptor-like protein classes, both of which are important for plant biotic defense. The colocalization of SV with plant defense response signal transduction pathways provides insight into the mechanisms of soybean resistance gene evolution and may inform the development of new approaches to resistance gene cloning.},

  abstract = {New sequencing technology has dramatically altered the landscape of whole-genome sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms. The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study, we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the different assemblers as well as other significant differences in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the genomes themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first, that data quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results, all of our data and methods are freely available, as are all assemblers used in this study.},

Due to their abundance and functional significance, a plethora of detection tools has been devised over the last two decades. Despite the longstanding interest, TR detection is still not resolved. Our large-scale tests reveal that current detectors produce different, often nonoverlapping inferences, reflecting characteristics of the underlying algorithms rather than the true distribution of TRs in genomic data. Our simulations show that the power of detecting TRs depends on the degree of their divergence, and repeat characteristics such as the length of the minimal repeat unit and their number in tandem. To reconcile the diverse predictions of current algorithms, we propose and evaluate several statistical criteria for measuring the quality of predicted repeat units. In particular, we propose a model-based phylogenetic classifier, entailing a maximum-likelihood estimation of the repeat divergence. Applied in conjunction with the state of the art detectors, our statistical classification scheme for inferred repeats allows to filter out false-positive predictions. Since different algorithms appear to specialize at predicting TRs with certain properties, we advise applying multiple detectors with subsequent filtering to obtain the most complete set of genuine repeats.},

We analyzed the role of DNA polymerases in the instability of Friedreich's ataxia (GAA)n repeats in a yeast experimental system. The elementary step of expansion corresponded to \$160 bp in the wild-type strain, matching the size of Okazaki fragments in yeast. This step increased when DNA polymerase a was mutated, suggesting a link between the scale of expansions and Okazaki fragment size. Expandable repeats strongly elevated the rate of mutations at substantial distances around them, a phenomenon we call repeat-induced mutagenesis (RIM). Notably, defects in the replicative DNA polymerases d and {$\epsilon$} strongly increased rates for both repeat expansions and RIM. The increases in repeat-mediated instability observed in DNA polymerase d mutants depended on translesion DNA polymerases. We conclude that repeat expansions and RIM are two sides of the same replicative mechanism.},

We demonstrate the error correction and assembly performance of SGA on 1.2 billion sequence reads from a human genome, which we are able to assemble using 54 GB of memory. The resulting contigs are highly accurate and contiguous, while covering 95\% of the reference genome (excluding contigs {$<$}200 bp in length). Because of the low memory requirements and parallelization without requiring inter-process communication, SGA provides the first practical assembler to our knowledge for a mammalian-sized genome on a low-end computing cluster.},

  abstract = {The plant genome evolves with rapid proliferation of LTR-type retrotransposons, which is associated with their clustered accumulation in gene-poor regions, such as centromeres. Despite their major role for plant genome evolution, no mobile LTR element with targeted integration into gene-poor regions has been identified in plants. Here, we report such targeted integrations de novo. We and others have previously shown that an               ATCOPIA93               family retrotransposon in               Arabidopsis thaliana               is mobilized when the DNA methylation machinery is compromised. Although               ATCOPIA93               family elements are low copy number in the wild-type               A. thaliana               genome, high-copy-number related elements are found in the wild-type               Arabidopsis lyrata               genome, and they show centromere-specific localization. To understand the mechanisms for the clustered accumulation of the               A. lyrata               elements directly, we introduced one of them, named               Tal1               (               Transposon of Arabidopsis lyrata 1               ), into               A. thaliana               by transformation.

The targeted integration is especially surprising because the centromeric repeat sequences differ considerably between               A. lyrata               and               A. thaliana               .

The accurate detection of insertions and deletions (indels) and errors introduced by the sequencing platform or by misreading of modified nucleotides is essential for the quantitative processing of the RNA-based sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets and for the identification of genetic variations and modification patterns. We developed a new, fast and accurate algorithm for nucleic acid sequence analysis, FANSe, with adjustable mismatch allowance settings and ability to handle indels to accurately and quantitatively map millions of reads to small or large reference genomes. It is a seed-based algorithm which uses the whole read information for mapping and high sensitivity and low ambiguity are achieved by using short and non-overlapping reads. Furthermore, FANSe uses hotspot score to prioritize the processing of highly possible matches and implements modified Smith\textendash Watermann refinement with reduced scoring matrix to accelerate the calculation without compromising its sensitivity. The FANSe algorithm stably processes datasets from various sequencing platforms, masked or unmasked and small or large genomes. It shows a remarkable coverage of low-abundance mRNAs which is important for quantitative processing of RNA-Seq datasets.},

  abstract = {Making the Change                            The Apocynaceae plant family produces toxic cardenolids. However, many insects have managed to escape the deleterious effects of these chemicals and even, in some cases, use them in their own defense.                                Zhen                 et al.                              (p.               1634               ) investigated a broad range of taxa and found several examples of parallel changes, as well as duplications, in members of the ATP{$\alpha$} family that likely explain the shift to allow insects to avoid the toxic effects of these plants. Thus, natural selection can harness a combination of gene duplication, protein evolution, and regulatory evolution to allow distantly related species to adapt to specific niches.                        ,              Parallel mutations in the alpha subunit of the sodium pump allow insects to specialize on host plants that produce ouabain.           ,                             Numerous insects have independently evolved the ability to feed on plants that produce toxic secondary compounds called cardenolides and can sequester these compounds for use in their defense. We surveyed the protein target for cardenolides, the alpha subunit of the sodium pump, Na               +               ,K               +               -ATPase (ATP{$\alpha$}), in 14 species that feed on cardenolide-producing plants and 15 outgroups spanning three insect orders. Despite the large number of potential targets for modulating cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions associated with host-plant specialization are highly clustered, with many parallel substitutions. Additionally, we document four independent duplications of ATP{$\alpha$} with convergent tissue-specific expression patterns. We find that unique substitutions are disproportionately associated with recent duplications relative to parallel substitutions. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that adaptation tends to take evolutionary paths that minimize negative pleiotropy.},

  abstract = {In a pair of seminal papers, Sewall Wright and Gustave Mal\'ecot introduced               F               ST               as a measure of structure in natural populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate               F               ST               from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of               F               ST               for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed\textemdash in some cases more than twofold\textemdash when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in               F               ST               from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of               F               ST               that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating               F               ST               for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of               F               ST               across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in               F               ST               estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions.},

  abstract = {Large-scale computational analyses of the growing wealth of genome-variation data consistently tell two distinct stories. The first is expected: coding variants reported in disease-related databases significantly alter the function of affected proteins. The second is surprising: the genomes of healthy individuals appear to carry many variants that are predicted to have some effect on function. As long as the complete experimental analysis of all human genome variants remains impossible, computational methods, such as PolyPhen, SNAP, and SIFT, might provide important insights. These methods capture the effects of particular variants very well and can highlight trends in populations of variants. Diseases are, arguably, extreme phenotypic variations and are often attributable to one or a few severely functionally disruptive variants. Our findings suggest a genomic basis of the different nondisease phenotypes. Prediction methods indicate that variants in seemingly healthy individuals tend to be neutral or weakly disruptive for protein molecular function. These variant effects are predicted to be largely either experimentally undetectable or are not deemed significant enough to be published. This may suggest that nondisease phenotypes arise through combinations of many variants whose effects are weakly nonneutral (damaging or enhancing) to the molecular protein function but fall within the wild-type range of overall physiological function.},

These regression models simultaneously fit many more markers than the number of observations available for the analysis. Thus, the Bayes theorem is used to combine prior beliefs of marker effects, which are expressed in terms of prior distributions, with information from data for inference. Often, the analyses are too complex for closed-form solutions and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is used to draw inferences from posterior distributions. This chapter describes how these Bayesian multiple-regression analyses can be used for GWAS. In most GWAS, false positives are controlled by limiting the genome-wise error rate, which is the probability of one or more false-positive results, to a small value. As the number of test in GWAS is very large, this results in very low power. Here we show how in Bayesian GWAS false positives can be controlled by limiting the proportion of false-positive results among all positives to some small value. The advantage of this approach is that the power of detecting associations is not inversely related to the number of markers.},

  abstract = {John Maynard Smith compared protein evolution to the game where one word is converted into another a single letter at a time, with the constraint that all intermediates are words: WORD\textrightarrow WORE\textrightarrow GORE\textrightarrow GONE\textrightarrow GENE. In this analogy, epistasis constrains evolution, with some mutations tolerated only after the occurrence of others. To test whether epistasis similarly constrains actual protein evolution, we created all intermediates along a 39-mutation evolutionary trajectory of influenza nucleoprotein, and also introduced each mutation individually into the parent. Several mutations were deleterious to the parent despite becoming fixed during evolution without negative impact. These mutations were destabilizing, and were preceded or accompanied by stabilizing mutations that alleviated their adverse effects. The constrained mutations occurred at sites enriched in T-cell epitopes, suggesting they promote viral immune escape. Our results paint a coherent portrait of epistasis during nucleoprotein evolution, with stabilizing mutations permitting otherwise inaccessible destabilizing mutations which are sometimes of adaptive value.           ,              During evolution, the effect of one mutation on a protein can depend on whether another mutation is also present. This phenomenon is similar to the game in which one word is converted to another word, one letter at a time, subject to the rule that all the intermediate steps are also valid words: for example, the word WORD can be converted to the word GENE as follows: WORD\textrightarrow WORE\textrightarrow GORE\textrightarrow GONE\textrightarrow GENE. In this example, the D must be changed to an E before the W is changed to a G, because GORD is not a valid word.             Similarly, during the evolution of a virus, a mutation that helps the virus evade the human immune system might only be tolerated if the virus has acquired another mutation beforehand. This type of mutational interaction would constrain the evolution of the virus, since its capacity to take advantage of the second mutation depends on the first mutation having already occurred.             Gong et al. examined whether such interactions have indeed constrained evolution of the influenza virus. Between 1968 and 2007, the nucleoprotein\textemdash which acts as a scaffold for the replication of genetic material\textemdash in the human H3N2 influenza virus underwent a series of 39 mutations. To test whether all of these mutations could have been tolerated by the 1968 virus, Gong et al. introduced each one individually into the 1968 nucleoprotein. They found that several mutations greatly reduced the fitness of the 1968 virus when introduced on their own, which strongly suggests that these `constrained mutations' became part of the virus's genetic makeup as a result of interactions with `enabling' mutations.             The constrained mutations decreased the stability of the nucleoprotein at high temperatures, while the enabling mutations counteracted this effect. It may, therefore, be possible to identify enabling mutations based on their effects on thermal stability. Intriguingly, the constrained mutations helped the virus overcome one form of human immunity to influenza, suggesting that interactions between mutations might limit the rate at which viruses evolve to evade the immune system.             Overall, these results show that interactions among mutations constrain the evolution of the influenza nucleoprotein in a fashion that can be largely understood in terms of protein stability. If the same is true for other proteins and viruses, this work could lead to a deeper understanding of the constraints that govern evolution at the molecular level.},

Recently, the method of higher criticism (HC) was shown to be an effective means for determining appropriate decision thresholds. Here, we study HC from a false discovery rate (FDR) perspective. We show that the HC threshold may be viewed as an approximation to a natural class boundary (CB) in two-class discriminant analysis which in turn is expressible as the FDR threshold. We demonstrate that in a rare\textendash weak setting in the region of the phase space where signal identification is possible, both thresholds are practicably indistinguishable, and thus HC thresholding is identical to using a simple local FDR cutoff. The relationship of the HC and CB thresholds and their properties are investigated both analytically and by simulations, and are further compared by the application to four cancer gene expression data sets.},

While methods have been developed to increase statistical power for detection of such effects, detecting subtle associations requires studies with hundreds or thousands of individuals, which is prohibitively costly. Recently, low-coverage sequencing has been shown to effectively reduce the cost of genome-wide association studies, using current sequencing technologies. However, current methods for disease association testing on rare variants cannot be applied directly to low-coverage sequencing data, as they require individual genotype data, which may not be called correctly due to low-coverage and inherent sequencing errors. In this article, we propose two novel methods for detecting association of rare variants with disease risk, using low coverage, error-prone sequencing. We show by simulation that our methods outperform previous methods under both low- and high-coverage sequencing and under different disease architectures. We use real data and simulation studies to demonstrate that to maximize the power to detect associations for a fixed budget, it is desirable to include more samples while lowering coverage and to perform an analysis using our suggested methods.},

  abstract = {Even with significant advances in technology, few studies of structural variation have yet resolved to the level of the precise nucleotide junction. We examined the sequence of 408,532 gains, 383,804 losses, and 166 inversions from the first sequenced personal genome, to quantify the relative proportion of mutational mechanisms. Among small variants ({$<$}1 kb), we observed that 72.6\% of them were associated with nonhomologous processes and 24.9\% with microsatellites events. Medium-size variants ({$<$}10 kb) were commonly related to minisatellites (25.8\%) and retrotransposons (24\%), whereas 46.2\% of large variants ({$>$}10 kb) were associated with nonallelic homologous recombination. We genotyped eight new breakpoint-resolved inversions at (3q26.1, Xp11.22, 7q11.22, 16q23.1, 4q22.1, 1q31.3, 6q27, and 16q24.1) in human populations to elucidate the structure of these presumed benign variants. Three of these inversions (3q26.1, 7q11.22, and 16q23.1) were accompanied by unexpected complex rearrangements. In particular, the 16q23.1 inversion and an accompanying deletion would create conjoined chymotrypsinogen genes (CTRB1 and CTRB2), disrupt their gene structure, and exhibit differentiated allelic frequencies among populations. Also, two loci (Xp11.3 and 6q27) of potential reference assembly orientation errors were found. This study provides a thorough account of formation mechanisms for structural variants, and reveals a glimpse of the dynamic structure of inversions.},

With the advent of next-generation sequencing TE insertionsite polymorphism can be examined at an unprecedented level of detail when combined with easy-to-use bioinformatics software. Here we report a new tool, RelocaTE, that rapidly identifies specific TE insertions that are either polymorphic or shared between a reference and unassembled next-generation sequencing reads. Furthermore, a novel companion tool, CharacTErizer, exploits the depth of coverage to classify genotypes of nonreference insertions as homozygous, heterozygous or, when analyzing an active TE family, as rare somatic insertion or excision events. It does this by comparing the numbers of RelocaTE aligned reads to reads that map to the same genomic position without the TE. Although RelocaTE and CharacTErizer can be used for any TE, they were developed to analyze the very active mPing element which is undergoing massive amplification in specific strains of Oryza sativa (rice). Three individuals of one of these strains, A123, were resequenced and analyzed for mPing insertion site polymorphisms. The majority of mPing insertions found (\textasciitilde 97\%) are not present in the reference, and two siblings from a self-crossed of this strain were found to share only \textasciitilde 90\% of their insertions. Private insertions are primarily heterozygous but include both homozygous and predicted somatic insertions. The reliability of the predicted genotypes was validated by polymerase chain reaction.},

Convergence often results from similar genetic changes, which can emerge in two ways: the evolution of similar or identical mutations in independent lineages, which is termed parallel evolution; and the evolution in independent lineages of alleles that are shared among populations, which I call collateral genetic evolution. Evidence for parallel and collateral evolution has been found in many taxa, and an emerging hypothesis is that they result from the fact that mutations in some genetic targets minimize pleiotropic effects while simultaneously maximizing adaptation. If this proves correct, then the molecular changes underlying adaptation might be more predictable than has been appreciated previously.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies of gene regulation often utilize genome-wide predictions of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Most existing prediction methods are based on sequence information alone, ignoring biological contexts such as developmental stages and tissue types. Experimental methods to study in vivo binding, including ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq, can only study one transcription factor in a single cell type and under a specific condition in each experiment, and therefore cannot scale to determine the full set of regulatory interactions in mammalian transcriptional regulatory networks. Results: We developed a new computational approach, PIPES, for predicting tissue-specific TF binding. PIPES integrates in vitro protein binding microarrays (PBMs), sequence conservation and tissue-specific epigenetic (DNase I hypersensitivity) information. We demonstrate that PIPES improves over existing methods on distinguishing between in vivo bound and unbound sequences using ChIP-seq data for 11 mouse TFs. In addition, our predictions are in good agreement with current knowledge of tissue-specific TF regulation. Conclusions: We provide a systematic map of computationally predicted tissue-specific binding targets for 284 mouse TFs across 55 tissue/cell types. Such comprehensive resource is useful for researchers studying gene regulation.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Bats are increasingly recognized as reservoir species for a variety of zoonotic viruses that pose severe threats to human health. While many RNA viruses have been identified in bats, little is known about bat retroviruses. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) represent genomic fossils of past retroviral infections and, thus, can inform us on the diversity and history of retroviruses that have infected a species lineage. Here, we took advantage of the availability of a high-quality genome assembly for the little brown bat,               Myotis lucifugus               , to systematically identify and analyze ERVs in this species. We mined an initial set of 362 potentially complete proviruses from the three main classes of ERVs, which were further resolved into 13 major families and 86 subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis. Consensus or representative sequences for each of the 86 subfamilies were then merged to the Repbase collection of known ERV/long terminal repeat (LTR) elements to annotate the retroviral complement of the bat genome. The results show that nearly 5\% of the genome assembly is occupied by ERV-derived sequences, a quantity comparable to findings for other eutherian mammals. About one-fourth of these sequences belong to subfamilies newly identified in this study. Using two independent methods, intraelement LTR divergence and analysis of orthologous loci in two other bat species, we found that the vast majority of the potentially complete proviruses identified in               M. lucifugus               were integrated in the last {$\sim$}25 million years. All three major ERV classes include recently integrated proviruses, suggesting that a wide diversity of retroviruses is still circulating in               Myotis               bats.},

Indeed, indels were successfully used to solve debated evolutionary relationships among various taxonomical groups. However, indels are never directly observed but rather inferred from the alignment and thus indel-based inference may be sensitive to alignment errors. It is hypothesized that phylogenetic reconstruction would be more accurate if it relied only on a subset of reliable indels instead of the entire indel data. Here, we developed a method to quantify the reliability of indel characters by measuring how often they appear in a set of alternative multiple sequence alignments. Our approach is based on the assumption that indels that are consistently present in most alternative alignments are more reliable compared with indels that appear only in a small subset of these alignments. Using simulated and empirical data, we studied the impact of filtering and weighting indels by their reliability scores on the accuracy of indel-based phylogenetic reconstruction.

Many studies have revealed that TEs are not simply ``junk'' DNA, but rather, they play various roles in processes, including genome evolution, gene expression regulation, genetic instability, and cancer disposition. The effects of TE insertion in the genome varies from negligible to disease conditions. For the past two decades, many studies have shown that TEs are the causative factors of various genetic disorders and cancer. TEs are a subject of interest worldwide, not only in terms of their clinical aspects but also in basic research, such as evolutionary tracking. Although active TEs contribute to genetic instability and disease states, non-long terminal repeat transposons are well studied, and their roles in these processes have been confirmed. In this review, we will give an overview of the importance of TEs in studying genome evolution and genetic instability, and we suggest that further in-depth studies on the mechanisms related to these phenomena will be useful for both evolutionary tracking and clinical diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Background: Of the different bioinformatic methods used to recover transposable elements (TEs) in genome sequences, one of the most commonly used procedures is the homology-based method proposed by the RepeatMasker program. RepeatMasker generates several output files, including the .out file, which provides annotations for all detected repeats in a query sequence. However, a remaining challenge consists of identifying the different copies of TEs that correspond to the identified hits. This step is essential for any evolutionary/comparative analysis of the different copies within a family. Different possibilities can lead to multiple hits corresponding to a unique copy of an element, such as the presence of large deletions/insertions or undetermined bases, and distinct consensus corresponding to a single full-length sequence (like for long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons). These possibilities must be taken into account to determine the exact number of TE copies. Results: We have developed a perl tool that parses the RepeatMasker .out file to better determine the number and positions of TE copies in the query sequence, in addition to computing quantitative information for the different families. To determine the accuracy of the program, we tested it on several RepeatMasker .out files corresponding to two organisms (Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens) for which the TE content has already been largely described and which present great differences in genome size, TE content, and TE families. Conclusions: Our tool provides access to detailed information concerning the TE content in a genome at the family level from the .out file of RepeatMasker. This information includes the exact position and orientation of each copy, its proportion in the query sequence, and its quality compared to the reference element. In addition, our tool allows a user to directly retrieve the sequence of each copy and obtain the same detailed information at the family level when a local library with incomplete TE class/subclass information was used with RepeatMasker. We hope that this tool will be helpful for people working on the distribution and evolution of TEs within genomes.},

However, the mechanistic links between genetic variation and methylation remain unclear. To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at ,300,000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide bisulfite sequence data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10\%) 13,915 cis methylation QTLs (meQTLs)\textemdash i.e., CpG sites in which changes in DNA methylation are associated with genetic variation at proximal loci. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes in all of these regulatory phenotypes. One plausible driver of coordinated changes in different regulatory mechanisms is variation in transcription factor (TF) binding. Indeed, we found that SNPs that change predicted TF binding affinities are significantly enriched for associations with DNA methylation at nearby CpGs.},

To shed light on the possible functional relevance of polymorphic coding region loss and the mechanisms driving this process, we characterized genes that have lost entire exons or their whole coding regions in 17 fully sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We found that although a significant enrichment in genes associated with certain functional categories is observed, PAV events are largely restricted to genes with signatures of reduced essentiality: PAV genes tend to be newer additions to the genome, tissue specific, and lowly expressed. In addition, PAV genes are located in regions of lower gene density and higher transposable element density. Partial coding region PAV events were associated with only a marginal reduction in gene expression level in the affected accession and occurred in genes with higher levels of alternative splicing in the Col-0 accession. Together, these results suggest that although adaptive scenarios cannot be ruled out, PAV events can be explained without invoking them.},

Here we propose a novel method for inferring causality that is no longer constrained by the conditional dependency arguments that limit the ability of statistical causal inference methods to resolve causal relationships within sets of graphical models that are Markov equivalent. Our method utilizes Bayesian belief propagation to infer the responses of perturbation events on molecular traits given a hypothesized graph structure. A distance measure between the inferred response distribution and the observed data is defined to assess the 'fitness' of the hypothesized causal relationships. To test our algorithm, we infer causal relationships within equivalence classes of gene networks in which the form of the functional interactions that are possible are assumed to be nonlinear, given synthetic microarray and RNA sequencing data. We also apply our method to infer causality in real metabolic network with v-structure and feedback loop. We show that our method can recapitulate the causal structure and recover the feedback loop only from steady-state data which conventional method cannot.},

The assembly of a 774 Mb reference sequence of wheat chromosome 3B provided us with the opportunity to explore the impact of TEs on the complex wheat genome structure and evolution at a resolution and scale not reached so far. Results: We develop an automated workflow, CLARI-TE, for TE modeling in complex genomes. We delineate precisely 56,488 intact and 196,391 fragmented TEs along the 3B pseudomolecule, accounting for 85\% of the sequence, and reconstruct 30,199 nested insertions. TEs have been mostly silent for the last one million years, and the 3B chromosome has been shaped by a succession of bursts that occurred between 1 to 3 million years ago. Accelerated TE elimination in the high-recombination distal regions is a driving force towards chromosome partitioning. CACTAs overrepresented in the high-recombination distal regions are significantly associated with recently duplicated genes. In addition, we identify 140 CACTA-mediated gene capture events with 17 genes potentially created by exon shuffling and show that 19 captured genes are transcribed and under selection pressure, suggesting the important role of CACTAs in the recent wheat adaptation. Conclusion: Accurate TE modeling uncovers the dynamics of TEs in a highly complex and polyploid genome. It provides novel insights into chromosome partitioning and highlights the role of CACTA transposons in the high level of gene duplication in wheat.},

In addition to vertical inheritance, horizontal gene transfer between reproductively isolated species has recently been shown to be an important, if not dominant, mechanism in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes. In contrast, only a few horizontal transfer (HT) events have been characterized so far in eukaryotes and mainly concern transposable elements (TEs). Whether these are frequent and have a significant impact on genome evolution remains largely unknown. We performed a computational search for highly conserved LTR retrotransposons among 40 sequenced eukaryotic genomes representing the major plant families. We found that 26 genomes (65\%) harbor at least one case of horizontal TE transfer (HTT). These transfers concern species as distantly related as palm and grapevine, tomato and bean, or poplar and peach. In total, we identified 32 cases of HTTs, which could translate into more than 2 million among the 13,551 monocot and dicot genera. Moreover, we show that these TEs have remained functional after their transfer, occasionally causing a transpositional burst. This suggests that plants can frequently exchange genetic material through horizontal transfers and that this mechanism may be important in TE-driven genome evolution.},

Interestingly, with linkage disequilibrium mapping, 76.7\% of the RTAs with at least one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) could be mapped to a single genetic position, distributed primarily throughout the nonpericentromeric portion of the genome. Stepwise iterative clustering of RTAs suggests, within the context of the genotypes used in this study, that the maize genome is restricted and further sampling of seedling RNA within this germplasm base will result in minimal discovery. Genome-wide association studies based on SNPs and transcript abundance in the pan-genome revealed loci associated with the timing of the juvenile-to-adult vegetative and vegetative-to-reproductive developmental transitions, two traits important for fitness and adaptation. This study revealed the dynamic nature of the maize pan-genome and demonstrated that a substantial portion of variation may lie outside the single reference genome for a species.},

Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic.},

In the long process of evolution, plants have developed a suite of sophisticated strategies to adapt to and to survive under the harsh environmental cues, among which transcriptional alteration constitutes an overriding mechanism. Stress-responsive genes can be classified into two major groups, functional genes and regulatory genes. Transcription factors play an essential role in the abiotic stress response by regulating the mRNA abundance of a large spectrum of downstream target genes via interaction with the cis -acting elements on the promoters of the genes. So far, several families of TFs and their interacting cis -acting elements, collectively called as regulons, have been well characterized to be key players closely implicated in abiotic stress responses. In the current overview, the major TFs and the cis-acting elements that have been extensively investigated in the last decades are introduced. In addition, future perspectives pertinent to their research directions are proposed, with the intention of gaining insight into better understanding and desirable application of the transcription factors.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) account for a large portion of the genome in many eukaryotic species. Despite their reputation as ``junk'' DNA or genomic parasites deleterious for the host, TEs have complex interactions with host genes and the potential to contribute to regulatory variation in gene expression. It has been hypothesized that TEs and genes they insert near may be transcriptionally activated in response to stress conditions. The maize genome, with many different types of TEs interspersed with genes, provides an ideal system to study the genome-wide influence of TEs on gene regulation. To analyze the magnitude of the TE effect on gene expression response to environmental changes, we profiled gene and TE transcript levels in maize seedlings exposed to a number of abiotic stresses. Many genes exhibit up- or down-regulation in response to these stress conditions. The analysis of TE families inserted within upstream regions of up-regulated genes revealed that between four and nine different TE families are associated with up-regulated gene expression in each of these stress conditions, affecting up to 20\% of the genes up-regulated in response to abiotic stress and as many as 33\% of genes that are only expressed in response to stress. Expression of many of these same TE families also responds to the same stress conditions. The analysis of the stressinduced transcripts and proximity of the transposon to the gene suggests that these TEs may provide local enhancer activities that stimulate stress-responsive gene expression. Our data on allelic variation for insertions of several of these TEs show strong correlation between the presence of TE insertions and stress-responsive up-regulation of gene expression. Our findings suggest that TEs provide an important source of allelic regulatory variation in gene response to abiotic stress in maize.},

Haplotype estimation in such cohorts is a central step in many downstream analyses. Using genotypes from six cohorts from isolated populations and two cohorts from non-isolated populations, we have investigated the performance of different phasing methods designed for nominally `unrelated' individuals. We find that SHAPEIT2 produces much lower switch error rates in all cohorts compared to other methods, including those designed specifically for isolated populations. In particular, when large amounts of IBD sharing is present, SHAPEIT2 infers close to perfect haplotypes. Based on these results we have developed a general strategy for phasing cohorts with any level of implicit or explicit relatedness between individuals. First SHAPEIT2 is run ignoring all explicit family information. We then apply a novel HMM method (duoHMM) to combine the SHAPEIT2 haplotypes with any family information to infer the inheritance pattern of each meiosis at all sites across each chromosome. This allows the correction of switch errors, detection of recombination events and genotyping errors. We show that the method detects numbers of recombination events that align very well with expectations based on genetic maps, and that it infers far fewer spurious recombination events than Merlin. The method can also detect genotyping errors and infer recombination events in otherwise uninformative families, such as trios and duos. The detected recombination events can be used in association scans for recombination phenotypes. The method provides a simple and unified approach to haplotype estimation, that will be of interest to researchers in the fields of human, animal and plant genetics.},

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

These datasets, in turn, provide unprecedented opportunities to reconstruct the history of human populations and detect genotype-phenotype association. Recently developed computational methods can identify long-range chromosomal segments that are identical across samples, and have been transmitted from common ancestors that lived tens to hundreds of generations in the past. These segments reveal genealogical relationships that are typically unknown to the carrying individuals. In this work, we demonstrate that such identical-by-descent (IBD) segments are informative about a number of relevant population genetics features: they enable the inference of details about past population size fluctuations, migration events, and they carry the genomic signature of natural selection. We derive a mathematical model, based on coalescent theory, that allows for a quantitative description of IBD sharing across purportedly unrelated individuals, and develop inference procedures for the reconstruction of recent demographic events, where classical methodologies are statistically underpowered. We analyze IBD sharing in several contemporary human populations, including representative communities of the Jewish Diaspora, Kenyan Maasai samples, and individuals from several Dutch provinces, in all cases retrieving evidence of fine-scale demographic events from recent history. Finally, we expand the presented model to describe distributions for those sites in IBD shared segments that harbor mutation events, showing how these may be used for the inference of mutation rates in humans and other species.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic variation in natural populations results from a combination of genetic effects, environmental effects, and geneby-environment interactions. Despite the vast amount of genomic data becoming available, many pressing questions remain about the nature of genetic mutations that underlie functional variation. We present the results of combining genome-wide association analysis of 41 different phenotypes in ,5,000 inbred maize lines to analyze patterns of highresolution genetic association among of 28.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ,800,000 copy-number variants (CNVs). We show that genic and intergenic regions have opposite patterns of enrichment, minor allele frequencies, and effect sizes, implying tradeoffs among the probability that a given polymorphism will have an effect, the detectable size of that effect, and its frequency in the population. We also find that genes tagged by GWAS are enriched for regulatory functions and are ,50\% more likely to have a paralog than expected by chance, indicating that gene regulation and gene duplication are strong drivers of phenotypic variation. These results will likely apply to many other organisms, especially ones with large and complex genomes like maize.},

  abstract = {Background: Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; E.C.4.3.1.5) is a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plant development, and it catalyses the deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, leading to the production of secondary metabolites. This enzyme has been identified in many organisms, ranging from prokaryotes to higher plants. Because Nelumbo nucifera is a basal dicot rich in many secondary metabolites, it is a suitable candidate for research on the phenylpropanoid pathway. Results: Three PAL members, NnPAL1, NnPAL2 and NnPAL3, have been identified in N. nucifera using genome-wide analysis. NnPAL1 contains two introns; however, both NnPAL2 and NnPAL3 have only one intron. Molecular and evolutionary analysis of NnPAL1 confirms that it is an ancient PAL member of the angiosperms and may have a different origin. However, PAL clusters, except NnPAL1, are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots. These observations suggest that duplication events remain an important occurrence in the evolution of the PAL gene family. Molecular assays demonstrate that the mRNA of the NnPAL1 gene is 2343 bp in size and encodes a 717 amino acid polypeptide. The optimal pH and temperature of the recombinant NnPAL1 protein are 9.0 and 55\textdegree C, respectively. The NnPAL1 protein retains both PAL and weak TAL catalytic activities with Km values of 1.07 mM for L-phenylalanine and 3.43 mM for L-tyrosine, respectively. Cis-elements response to environmental stress are identified and confirmed using real-time PCR for treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), ultraviolet light, Neurospora crassa (fungi) and drought. Conclusions: We conclude that the angiosperm PAL genes are not derived from a single gene in an ancestral angiosperm genome; therefore, there may be another ancestral duplication and vertical inheritance from the gymnosperms. The different evolutionary histories for PAL genes in angiosperms suggest different mechanisms of functional regulation. The expression patterns of NnPAL1 in response to stress may be necessary for the survival of N. nucifera since the Cretaceous Period. The discovery and characterisation of the ancient NnPAL1 help to elucidate PAL evolution in angiosperms.},

Recently, a new sequencing platform PacBio RS II, known as `SMRT (Single Molecule, Real-Time) sequencing', has been developed. Using the SMRT sequencing to investigate the chloroplast genome of N. nucifera will help to elucidate the plastid evolution of basal eudicots. Results: The sizes of the de novo assembled complete chloroplast genome of N. nucifera were 163,307 bp, 163,747 bp and 163,600 bp with average depths of coverage of 7\texttimes, 712\texttimes{} and 105\texttimes{} sequenced by Sanger, Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II, respectively. The precise chloroplast genome of N. nucifera was obtained from PacBio RS II data proofread by Illumina MiSeq reads, with a quadripartite structure containing a large single copy region (91,846 bp) and a small single copy region (19,626 bp) separated by two inverted repeat regions (26,064 bp). The genome contains 113 different genes, including four distinct rRNAs, 30 distinct tRNAs and 79 distinct peptide-coding genes. A phylogenetic analysis of 133 taxa from 56 orders indicated that Nelumbo with an age of 177 million years is a sister clade to Platanus, which belongs to the basal eudicots. Basal eudicots began to emerge during the early Jurassic with estimated divergence times at 197 million years using MCMCTree. IR expansions/contractions within the basal eudicots seem to have occurred independently. Conclusions: Because of long reads and lack of bias in coverage of AT-rich regions, PacBio RS II showed a great promise for highly accurate `finished' genomes, especially for a de novo assembly of genomes. N. nucifera is one member of basal eudicots, however, evolutionary analyses of IR structural variations of N. nucifera and other basal eudicots suggested that IR expansions/contractions occurred independently in these basal eudicots or were caused by independent insertions and deletions. The precise chloroplast genome of N. nucifera will present new information for structural variation of chloroplast genomes and provide new insight into the evolution of basal eudicots at the primary sequence and structural level.},

Studying the dynamics of transposition at the population level can provide crucial insights into the processes and mechanisms of genome evolution. Pooling genomic materials from multiple individuals followed by high-throughput sequencing is an efficient way of characterizing genomic polymorphisms in a population. Here we describe a novel method named TEMP, specifically designed to detect TE movements present with a wide range of frequencies in a population. By combining the information provided by pair-end reads and split reads, TEMP is able to identify both the presence and absence of TE insertions in genomic DNA sequences derived from heterogeneous samples; accurately estimate the frequencies of transposition events in the population and pinpoint junctions of high frequency transposition events at nucleotide resolution. Simulation data indicate that TEMP outperforms other algorithms such as PoPoolationTE, RetroSeq, VariationHunter and GASVPro. TEMP also performs well on whole-genome human data derived from the 1000 Genomes Project. We applied TEMP to characterize the TE frequencies in a wild Drosophila melanogaster population and study the inheritance patterns of TEs during hybrid dysgenesis. We also identified sequence signatures of TE insertion and possible molecular effects of TE movements, such as altered gene expression and piRNA production.

This variation is highly informative for population and conservation genetics. It has also been associated with several pathological conditions and with gene expression regulation. However, genome-wide surveys of TR variation in humans and closely related species have been scarce due to technical difficulties derived from short-read technology. Here we explored the genome-wide diversity of TRs in a panel of 83 human and nonhuman great ape genomes, in a total of six different species, and studied their impact on gene expression evolution. We found that population diversity patterns can be efficiently captured with short TRs (repeat unit length, 1\textendash 5 bp). We examined the potential evolutionary role of TRs in gene expression differences between humans and primates by using 30,275 larger TRs (repeat unit length, 2\textendash 50 bp). Genes that contained TRs in the promoters, in their 3{${'}$} untranslated region, in introns, and in exons had higher expression divergence than genes without repeats in the regions. Polymorphic small repeats (1\textendash 5 bp) had also higher expression divergence compared with genes with fixed or no TRs in the gene promoters. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of TRs to human evolution through gene regulation.},

We identified 382,901 SNPs in the study samples, including 2,002 (0.52\%) triallelic sites. Among the triallelic SNPs, 17.3\% were coding SNPs (cSNPs) and 78.3\% were novel. Comparison and analysis revealed that the variant alleles were more likely to result in nonsynonymous variation at triallelic sites. In addition, natural selection seemed to influence triallelic SNPs. However, with the limited sample size assessed, more studies will be required in order to fully characterize the features of triallelic SNPs.},

Klebsiella species are Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the large Enterobacteriaceae family. Interestingly, when comparing the core/pan-genome ratio; we found a clear discontinuous variation that can define a new species. Conclusions: Using this pan-genomic approach, we showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis are species of the Klebsiella genus, rather than subspecies of Klebsiella pneumoniae. This pan-genomic analysis, helped to develop a new tool for defining species introducing a quantic perspective for taxonomy.

  abstract = {The number of genomes that have been deposited in databases has increased exponentially after the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), which produces high-throughput sequence data; this circumstance has demanded the development of new bioinformatics software and the creation of new areas, such as comparative genomics. In comparative genomics, the genetic content of an organism is compared against other organisms, which helps in the prediction of gene function and coding region sequences, identification of evolutionary events and determination of phylogenetic relationships. However, expanding comparative genomics to a large number of related bacteria, we can infer their lifestyles, gene repertoires and minimal genome size. In this context, a powerful approach called Pan-genome has been initiated and developed. This approach involves the genomic comparison of different strains of the same species, or even genus. Its main goal is to establish the total number of non-redundant genes that are present in a determined dataset. Pan-genome consists of three parts: core genome; accessory or dispensable genome; and species-specific or strain-specific genes. Furthermore, pan-genome is considered to be ``open'' as long as new genes are added significantly to the total repertoire for each new additional genome and ``closed'' when the newly added genomes cannot be inferred to significantly increase the total repertoire of the genes. To perform all of the required calculations, a substantial amount of software has been developed, based on orthologous and paralogous gene identification.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are major components of vertebrate genomes, with major roles in genome architecture and evolution. In order to characterize both common patterns and lineage-specific differences in TE content and TE evolution, we have compared the mobilomes of 23 vertebrate genomes, including 10 actinopterygian fish, 11 sarcopterygians, and 2 nonbony vertebrates. We found important variations in TE content (from 6\% in the pufferfish tetraodon to 55\% in zebrafish), with a more important relative contribution of TEs to genome size in fish than in mammals. Some TE superfamilies were found to be widespread in vertebrates, but most elements showed a more patchy distribution, indicative of multiple events of loss or gain. Interestingly, loss of major TE families was observed during the evolution of the sarcopterygian lineage, with a particularly strong reduction in TE diversity in birds and mammals. Phylogenetic trends in TE composition and activity were detected: Teleost fish genomes are dominated by DNA transposons and contain few ancient TE copies, while mammalian genomes have been predominantly shaped by nonlong terminal repeat retrotransposons, along with the persistence of older sequences. Differences were also found within lineages: The medaka fish genome underwent more recent TE amplification than the related platyfish, as observed for LINE retrotransposons in the mouse compared with the human genome. This study allows the identification of putative cases of horizontal transfer of TEs, and to tentatively infer the composition of the ancestral vertebrate mobilome. Taken together, the results obtained highlight the importance of TEs in the structure and evolution of vertebrate genomes, and demonstrate their major impact on genome diversity both between and within lineages.},

Unfortunately, these comparisons are not straightforward with the current Variant Call Files (VCF), which are the standard output of most variant calling algorithms for high-throughput sequencing data. Comparisons of VCFs are often confounded by the different representations of indels, MNPs, and combinations thereof with SNVs in complex regions of the genome, resulting in misleading results. A variant caller is inherently a classification method designed to score putative variants with confidence scores that could permit controlling the rate of false positives (FP) or false negatives (FN) for a given application. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and the area under the ROC (AUC) are efficient metrics to evaluate a test call set versus a gold standard. However, in the case of VCF data this also requires a special accounting to deal with discrepant representations. We developed a novel algorithm for comparing variant call sets that deals with complex call representation discrepancies and through a dynamic programing method that minimizes false positives and negatives globally across the entire call sets for accurate performance evaluation of VCFs.},

  abstract = {Background: Maize (Zea mays) is a globally produced crop with broad genetic and phenotypic variation. New tools that improve our understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits are needed to guide predictive crop breeding. We have produced the first balanced multi-parental population in maize, a tool that provides high diversity and dense recombination events to allow routine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in maize. Results: We produced 1,636 MAGIC maize recombinant inbred lines derived from eight genetically diverse founder lines. The characterization of 529 MAGIC maize lines shows that the population is a balanced, evenly differentiated mosaic of the eight founders, with mapping power and resolution strengthened by high minor allele frequencies and a fast decay of linkage disequilibrium. We show how MAGIC maize may find strong candidate genes by incorporating genome sequencing and transcriptomics data. We discuss three QTL for grain yield and three for flowering time, reporting candidate genes. Power simulations show that subsets of MAGIC maize might achieve high-power and high-definition QTL mapping. Conclusions: We demonstrate MAGIC maize's value in identifying the genetic bases of complex traits of agronomic relevance. The design of MAGIC maize allows the accumulation of sequencing and transcriptomics layers to guide the identification of candidate genes for a number of maize traits at different developmental stages. The characterization of the full MAGIC maize population will lead to higher power and definition in QTL mapping, and lay the basis for improved understanding of maize phenotypes, heterosis included.

Complete understanding of genome function and evolution cannot be achieved without a thorough understanding of TE impact and biology.

T-lex2 is the only available software that allows routine, automatic and accurate genotyping of individual TE insertions and estimation of their population frequencies both using individual strain and pooled next-generation sequencing data. Furthermore, Tlex2 also assesses the quality of the calls allowing the identification of miss-annotated TEs and providing the necessary information to re-annotate them. The flexible and customizable design of T-lex2 allows running it in any genome and for any type of TE insertion. Here, we tested the fidelity of T-lex2 using the fly and human genomes. Overall, T-lex2 represents a significant improvement in our ability to analyze the contribution of TEs to genome function and evolution as well as learning about the biology of TEs.

In the absence of standard benchmarks, toolmakers are impeded in improving their tools, annotators cannot properly assess which tools might best suit their needs, and downstream researchers cannot judge how accuracy limitations might impact their studies.

In the present study, to dissect large-scale genomic molecular marker resources for sacred lotus, we re-sequenced a Thailand sacred lotus cultivar `Chiang Mai wild lotus' and compared with the reported lotus genome `Middle lake wild lotus'. A total of 3,180,059 SNPs, 328, 251 InDels and 14,191 SVs were found between the two genomes. The functional impact analyses of these SNPs indicated that they may be involved in metabolic processes, binding, catalytic activity, etc. Mining the genome sequences for SSRs showed that 191,657 SSRs were identified with a frequency of one SSR per 4.23 kb and 103,656 SSR primer pairs were designed. Furthermore, 14, 502 ESTSSRs were also indentified using the available RNA-seq data in the NCBI. A subset of 150 SSRs (genomic and EST-SSRs) was randomly selected for validation and genetic diversity analysis. The genotypes could be easily distinguished using these SSR markers and the `Chiang Mai wild lotus' was obviously differentiated from the other Chinese accessions. This study provides considerable amounts of genomic resources and markers for the quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification and molecular selection of the species, which could have a potential role in various applications in sacred lotus breeding.},

To investigate the impact of selection on variants distributed among homoeologous wheat genomes and to build a foundation for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships, we performed population-scale re-sequencing of a diverse panel of wheat lines. Results: A sample of 62 diverse lines was re-sequenced using the whole exome capture and genotyping-by-sequencing approaches. We describe the allele frequency, functional significance, and chromosomal distribution of 1.57 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 161,719 small indels. Our results suggest that duplicated homoeologous genes are under purifying selection. We find contrasting patterns of variation and inter-variant associations among wheat genomes; this, in addition to demographic factors, could be explained by differences in the effect of directional selection on duplicated homoeologs. Only a small fraction of the homoeologous regions harboring selected variants overlapped among the wheat genomes in any given wheat line. These selected regions are enriched for loci associated with agronomic traits detected in genome-wide association studies. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that directional selection in allopolyploids rarely acted on multiple parallel advantageous mutations across homoeologous regions, likely indicating that a fitness benefit could be obtained by a mutation at any one of the homoeologs. Additional advantageous variants in other homoelogs probably either contributed little benefit, or were unavailable in populations subjected to directional selection. We hypothesize that allopolyploidy may have increased the likelihood of beneficial allele recovery by broadening the set of possible selection targets.},

  abstract = {Background: Transposable elements constitute an important part of the genome and are essential in adaptive mechanisms. Transposition events associated with phenotypic changes occur naturally or are induced in insertional mutant populations. Transposon mutagenesis results in multiple random insertions and recovery of most/all the insertions is critical for forward genetics study. Using genome next-generation sequencing data and appropriate bioinformatics tool, it is plausible to accurately identify transposon insertion sites, which could provide candidate causal mutations for desired phenotypes for further functional validation. Results: We developed a novel bioinformatics tool, ITIS (Identification of Transposon Insertion Sites), for localizing transposon insertion sites within a genome. It takes next-generation genome re-sequencing data (NGS data), transposon sequence, and reference genome sequence as input, and generates a list of highly reliable candidate insertion sites as well as zygosity information of each insertion. Using a simulated dataset and a case study based on an insertional mutant line from Medicago truncatula, we showed that ITIS performed better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than other similar algorithms such as RelocaTE, RetroSeq, TEMP and TIF. With the case study data, we demonstrated the efficiency of ITIS by validating the presence and zygosity of predicted insertion sites of the Tnt1 transposon within a complex plant system, M. truncatula. Conclusion: This study showed that ITIS is a robust and powerful tool for forward genetic studies in identifying transposable element insertions causing phenotypes. ITIS is suitable in various systems such as cell culture, bacteria, yeast, insect, mammal and plant.},

  abstract = {The molecular clock of neutral mutations, which represents linear mutation fixation over generations, is theoretically explained by genetic drift in fitness-steady evolution or hitchhiking in adaptive evolution. The present study is the first experimental demonstration for the molecular clock of neutral mutations in a fitness-increasing evolutionary process. The dynamics of genome mutation fixation in the thermal adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli were evaluated in a prolonged evolution experiment in duplicated lineages. The cells from the continuously fitness-increasing evolutionary process were subjected to genome sequencing and analyzed at both the population and single-colony levels. Although the dynamics of genome mutation fixation were complicated by the combination of the stochastic appearance of adaptive mutations and clonal interference, the mutation fixation in the population was simply linear over generations. Each genome in the population accumulated 1.6 synonymous and 3.1 non-synonymous neutral mutations, on average, by the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate, while only a single genome in the population occasionally acquired an adaptive mutation. The neutral mutations that preexisted on the single genome hitchhiked on the domination of the adaptive mutation. The successive fixation processes of the 128 mutations demonstrated that hitchhiking and not genetic drift were responsible for the coincidence of the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate in the genome with the fixation rate of neutral mutations in the population. The molecular clock of neutral mutations to the fitness-increasing evolution suggests that the numerous neutral mutations observed in molecular phylogenetic trees may not always have been fixed in fitness-steady evolution but in adaptive evolution.},

However, as different callers are geared towards different types of structural variation, there is still no single caller that can be considered a community standard; instead, increasingly the various callers are combined in integrated pipelines. In this article, we review a wide range of callers, discuss challenges in the integration step and present a survey of pipelines used in population genomics studies.

  abstract = {The differential accumulation and elimination of repetitive DNA are key drivers of genome size variation in flowering plants, yet there have been few studies which have analysed how different types of repeats in related species contribute to genome size evolution within a phylogenetic context. This question is addressed here by conducting large-scale comparative analysis of repeats in 23 species from four genera of the monophyletic legume tribe Fabeae, representing a 7.6-fold variation in genome size. Phylogenetic analysis and genome size reconstruction revealed that this diversity arose from genome size expansions and contractions in different lineages during the evolution of Fabeae. Employing a combination of low-pass genome sequencing with novel bioinformatic approaches resulted in identification and quantification of repeats making up 55\textendash 83\% of the investigated genomes. In turn, this enabled an analysis of how each major repeat type contributed to the genome size variation encountered. Differential accumulation of repetitive DNA was found to account for 85\% of the genome size differences between the species, and most (57\%) of this variation was found to be driven by a single lineage of Ty3/gypsy LTR-retrotransposons, the Ogre elements. Although the amounts of several other lineages of LTR-retrotransposons and the total amount of satellite DNA were also positively correlated with genome size, their contributions to genome size variation were much smaller (up to 6\%). Repeat analysis within a phylogenetic framework also revealed profound differences in the extent of sequence conservation between different repeat types across Fabeae. In addition to these findings, the study has provided a proof of concept for the approach combining recent developments in sequencing and bioinformatics to perform comparative analyses of repetitive DNAs in a large number of non-model species without the need to assemble their genomes.},

Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft-clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired-end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV across various SV types and sizes.},

We describe an extension of our Cactus software to create a pan-genome reference for whole genome alignments, and demonstrate how it can be used to create novel genome browser visualizations using human variation data as a test.

As new information becomes available we should constantly be updating and reanalyzing existing and newly acquired data. In this report we focus on transposable elements (TEs) which make up a significant portion of nearly all sequenced genomes. Our ability to accurately identify and classify these sequences is critical to understanding their impact on host genomes. At the same time, as we demonstrate in this report, problems with existing classification schemes have led to significant misunderstandings of the evolution of both TE sequences and their host genomes. In a pioneering publication Finnegan (1989) proposed classifying all TE sequences into two classes based on transposition mechanisms and structural features: the retrotransposons (class I) and the DNA transposons (class II). We have retraced how ideas regarding TE classification and annotation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic scientific communities have changed over time. This has led us to observe that: (1) a number of TEs have convergent structural features and/or transposition mechanisms that have led to misleading conclusions regarding their classification, (2) the evolution of TEs is similar to that of viruses by having several unrelated origins, (3) there might be at least 8 classes and 12 orders of TEs including 10 novel orders.},

The stable secondary hairpin structures formed by TNR may trigger fork stalling during replication, causing DNA polymerase slippage and TNR expansion. Srs2 and Sgs1 are two helicases in yeast that resolve TNR hairpins during DNA replication and prevent genome expansion. Using single-molecule fluorescence, we investigated the unwinding mechanism by which Srs2 and Sgs1 resolves TNR hairpin and compared it with unwinding of duplex DNA. While Sgs1 unwinds both structures indiscriminately, Srs2 displays repetitive unfolding of TNR hairpin without fully unwinding it. Such activity of Srs2 shows dependence on the folding strength and the total length of TNR hairpin. Our results reveal a disparate molecular mechanism of Srs2 and Sgs1 that may contribute differently to efficient resolving of the TNR hairpin.},

  abstract = {The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt through a shared genetic response is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology. In this article, we explore how standing genetic variation contributes to convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population. Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele, hence allowing other alleles to spread before any one comes to dominate the population. When selectively equivalent alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed, dividing the species range into a random tessellation, which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization. In this framework, we derive the geographic scale over which an allele dominates and the proportion of adaptive alleles that arise from standing variation. Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles can bias the subset of alleles that contribute to the species' adaptive response. We apply the results to the malaria-resistance glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\textendash deficiency alleles, where the large mutational target size makes it a likely candidate for adaptation from deleterious standing variation. Our results suggest that convergent adaptation may be common. Therefore, caution must be exercised when arguing that strongly geographically restricted alleles are the outcome of local adaptation. We close by discussing the implications of these results for ideas of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.},

Understanding the genetic diversity in maize is thus vital for crop improvement and breeding studies. We performed four different multi-allele detecting marker systems amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP), methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP), and transposon display methylation amplified polymorphism (TD-MSAP) to analyze genetic and epigenetic variation and diversity among dent, waxy, and sweet corn. The (epi) genetic diversity, (epi) genetic distance, gene flow, genetic frequency, cluster analysis, PCoA, and AMOVA analysis were calculated. Cultivar differentiation is well-established in maize, and the results suggest that not only genetic but also epigenetic variation is responsible for the differences obtained in maize cultivars. Estimates of genetic relationship were significantly correlated between the AFLP, SSAP, and MSAP datasets. The current study is the first report on the systematic comparison of TD-MSAP with the other marker systems. The genetic variation detected by TD-MSAP was higher than that calculated by AFLP, SSAP, and MSAP but was in discordance with accepted genetic relationships.},

The long history of genetic investigation in this species combined with modern genomic and quantitative genetic data has provided particular insight into the characteristics of genes linked to phenotypes and how these genes differ from many other sequences in plant genomes that are not easily distinguishable based on molecular data alone. These recent results suggest that the number of genes in plants that make significant contributions to phenotype may be lower than the number of genes defined by current molecular criteria, and also indicate that syntenic conservation has been underemphasized as a marker for gene function.},

In humans, these repeats are linked to genomic instabilities that result in various hereditary disorders, including many cancers. It has long been known that DNA repeats are not only highly polymorphic in length but can also cause chromosomal fragility and stimulate gross chromosomal rearrangements, i.e., deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations and more complex shuffles. More recently, it has become clear that inherently unstable DNA repeats dramatically elevate mutation rates in surrounding DNA segments and that these mutations can occur up to ten kilobases away from the repetitive tract, a phenomenon we call repeat-induced mutagenesis (RIM). This review describes experimental data that led to the discovery and characterization of RIM and discusses the molecular mechanisms that could account for this phenomenon.},

We discuss replacement and additive HGT, the proposed mechanisms of HGT, selective forces that influence HGT, and the evolutionary impact of HGT on ancestral populations and existing populations such as the human microbiome.},

This problem of fine-mapping association signals predates GWAS, but the last few years have seen a surge of studies aimed at pinpointing causal variants using both statistical evidence from large association data sets and functional annotations of genetic variants. Combining these two approaches can often determine not only the causal variant but also the target gene. Recent contributions include analyses of custom genotyping arrays, such as the Immunochip, statistical methods to identify credible sets of causal variants and the addition of functional genomic annotations for coding and non-coding variation to help prioritize variants and discern functional consequence and hence the biological basis of disease risk.},

  abstract = {Background: The dispensable genome of a species, consisting of the dispensable sequences present only in a subset of individuals, is believed to play important roles in phenotypic variation and genome evolution. However, construction of the dispensable genome is costly and labor-intensive at present, and so the influence of the dispensable genome in genetic and functional genomic studies has not been fully explored. Results: We construct the dispensable genome of rice through a metagenome-like de novo assembly strategy based on low-coverage (1\textendash 3\texttimes ) sequencing data of 1483 cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) accessions. Thousands of protein-coding genes are successfully assembled, including most of the known agronomically important genes absent from the Nipponbare rice reference genome. We develop an integration approach based on alignment and linkage disequilibrium, which is able to assign genomic positions relative to the reference genome for more than 78.2 \% of the dispensable sequences. We carry out association mapping studies for rice grain width and 840 metabolic traits using 0.46 million polymorphisms between the dispensable sequences of different rice accessions. About 23.5 \% of metabolic traits have more significant association signals with polymorphisms from dispensable sequences than with SNPs from the reference genome, and 41.6 \% of trait-associated SNPs have concordant genomic locations with associated dispensable sequences. Conclusions: Our results suggest the feasibility of building a species' dispensable genome using low-coverage population sequencing data. The constructed sequences will be helpful for understanding the rice dispensable genome and are complementary to the reference genome for identifying candidate genes associated with phenotypic variation.},

From 10 sequential cohorts of staged maize anthers plus mature pollen we find that 21-nt phased siRNAs from 463 loci appear abruptly after germinal and initial somatic cell fate specification and then diminish, whereas 24-nt phasiRNAs from 176 loci coordinately accumulate during meiosis and persist as anther somatic cells mature and haploid gametophytes differentiate into pollen. Male-sterile               ocl4               anthers defective in epidermal signaling lack 21-nt phasiRNAs. Male-sterile mutants with subepidermal defects\textemdash{}               mac1               (excess meiocytes),               ms23               (defective pretapetal cells), and               msca1               (no normal soma or meiocytes)\textemdash lack 24-nt phasiRNAs.               ameiotic1               mutants (normal soma, no meiosis) accumulate both 21-nt and 24-nt phasiRNAs, ruling out meiotic cells as a source or regulator of phasiRNA biogenesis. By in situ hybridization, miR2118 triggers of 21-nt phasiRNA biogenesis localize to epidermis; however, 21-               PHAS               precursors and 21-nt phasiRNAs are abundant subepidermally. The miR2275 trigger, 24-               PHAS               precursors, and 24-nt phasiRNAs all accumulate preferentially in tapetum and meiocytes. Therefore, each phasiRNA type exhibits independent spatiotemporal regulation with 21-nt premeiotic phasiRNAs dependent on epidermal and 24-nt meiotic phasiRNAs dependent on tapetal cell differentiation. Maize phasiRNAs and mammalian piRNAs illustrate putative convergent evolution of small RNAs in male reproduction.},

In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pangenome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pangenomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.},

Examples of most important cis-regulatory elements are reviewed in the present paper. Variability among core promoters content and distal promoter regions impedes evaluation of interactions between them during the artificial promoters construction. Synthetic promoters and artificial expression cassettes trigger a significant increase in gene expression level, better properties and quality of a product. Accumulating knowledge about gene promoters, cis sequences and their cooperating factors allows uniform expression systems and highly predictable results.},

Now, with our knowledge of whole genome sequences, repetitive sequences can be used to identify polymorphisms that can be mapped and scored in a systematic manner. We have developed a simple, robust platform for designing primers, PCR amplification, and high throughput cloning that allows hundreds to thousands of markers to be scored for less than \$5 per sample. Conserved regions were used to design PCR primers for amplifying thousands of middle repetitive regions of the maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) genome. Bioinformatic scans were then used to identify DNA sequence polymorphisms in the low copy intervening sequences. When used in conjunction with simple DNA preps, optimized PCR conditions, high multiplex Illumina indexing and a bioinformatic marker calling platform tailored for repetitive sequences, this methodology provides a cost effective genotyping strategy for large-scale genomic selection projects. We show detailed results from four maize primer sets that produced between 1,335-3,225 good coverage loci with 1056 that segregated appropriately in a biparental family. This approach could have wide applicability to breeding and conservation biology, where hundreds of thousands of samples need to be genotyped for very minimal cost.},

Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the Hominidae (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related Hominidae lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing environments. Most signatures of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 minutes. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to basepair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.},

  abstract = {To characterize natural selection, various analytical methods for detecting candidate genomic regions have been developed. We propose to perform genome-wide scans of natural selection using principal component analysis (PCA). We show that the common FST index of genetic differentiation between populations can be viewed as the proportion of variance explained by the principal components. Considering the correlations between genetic variants and each principal component provides a conceptual framework to detect genetic variants involved in local adaptation without any prior definition of populations. To validate the PCA-based approach, we consider the 1000 Genomes data (phase 1) considering 850 individuals coming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number of genetic variants is of the order of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage sequencing depth (3\^A). The correlations between genetic variation and each principal component provide well-known targets for positive selection (EDAR, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, DARC), and also new candidate genes (APPBPP2, TP1A1, RTTN, KCNMA, MYO5C) and noncoding RNAs. In addition to identifying genes involved in biological adaptation, we identify two biological pathways involved in polygenic adaptation that are related to the innate immune system (beta defensins) and to lipid metabolism (fatty acid omega oxidation). An additional analysis of European data shows that a genome scan based on PCA retrieves classical examples of local adaptation even when there are no well-defined populations. PCA-based statistics, implemented in the PCAdapt R package and the PCAdapt fast open-source software, retrieve well-known signals of human adaptation, which is encouraging for future whole-genome sequencing project, especially when defining populations is difficult.},

  abstract = {Parasitic DNAs help and hinder evolution                            Transposable elements are parasitic DNAs that can duplicate themselves and jump around their host genomes. They can both disrupt gene function and drive genome evolution. Elbarbary               et al.               review the roles of two classes of transposable elements in gene regulation and disease: long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs). Roughly a third of the human genome consists of LINEs and SINEs. They contribute to a broad range of important genome and gene regulatory features, while at the same time being responsible for number of human diseases.                                         Science               , this issue p.               10.1126/science.aac7247                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Genomes are subject to two types of changes: changes to the DNA sequence, and changes that are epigenetic in nature. Changes to the DNA sequence can result from errors made during DNA replication and/or repair, or from the insertion of mobile DNA. Mobile DNAs, also called transposable elements (TEs), have the potential to provide regulatory and/or protein-coding sequences at a new integration site. Depending on its nucleotide sequence and genomic insertion site, an individual TE can disrupt gene expression, directly or indirectly create an advantageous modification to gene expression, or be of no immediate consequence. Changes can be genetic, epigenetic, or both. In this way, TEs are molecular parasites and evolutionary drivers, each role originating from the ability to insert into, spread through, and restructure genomes. This review focuses on the types of TEs that transpose via RNA intermediates\textemdash retrotransposons\textemdash that are not bounded by long terminal repeats. The most abundant retrotransposons in animal genomes come in two forms: long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs).                                         ADVANCES               The advent of deep genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, together with studies of individual LINE or SINE functions, has led to a greater appreciation of how the two TEs influence gene expression. Our review focuses principally on data that derive from human and mouse studies. These data demonstrate that LINEs and SINEs perform many diverse roles within cells. As DNA sequences, they can regulate gene transcription by altering chromatin structure and by functioning as enhancers or promoters. When transcribed as part of a larger transcript, they can create new transcript isoforms (by influencing alternative pre-mRNA splicing or 3{${'}$}-end formation), alter mRNA localization, change mRNA stability, tune the level of mRNA translation, or encode amino acids that diversify the proteome. Further, the RNA transcripts of LINEs or SINEs may themselves function to regulate gene expression. Through their various roles, TEs influence many aspects of cellular metabolism, including the ability to divide, migrate, differentiate, and respond to stress.                                         OUTLOOK               TEs continue to spread throughout our genomes in both gametes and somatic tissues, introducing new gene regulatory activities or causing disease. Although deep transcriptome sequencing has identified a myriad of SINE-containing noncoding RNAs, the functional importance of most of these transcripts remains unknown. Additionally, we need to understand the consequence of the very high degree of TE transposition in our brains. We also need to uncover the determinants that influence the effect of a specific SINE on gene expression, and, given that different organisms can contain SINEs of distinct origins, the extent to which these SINEs contribute to species-specific differences. Moreover, it will be important to determine the extent to which independently evolved SINEs have been co-opted for similar functions.                                                   Some of the steps in the expression of mammalian genes that can be affected by cis- or trans-acting LINEs or SINEs.                   LINE and SINE genomic insertions can regulate gene expression by altering transcription and/or chromatin structure. When embedded in the transcripts of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)\textendash transcribed genes, SINEs can influence nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear mRNA retention in paraspeckles, cytoplasmic mRNA stability, or cytoplasmic mRNA translation.\hspace{0pt} ARE-BP, AU-rich element\textendash binding protein.

We focus on two types of TEs: long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs). LINEs and SINEs are retrotransposons; that is, they transpose via an RNA intermediate. We discuss how LINEs and SINEs have expanded in eukaryotic genomes and contribute to genome evolution. An emerging body of evidence indicates that LINEs and SINEs function to regulate gene expression by affecting chromatin structure, gene transcription, pre-mRNA processing, or aspects of mRNA metabolism. We also describe how adenosine-to-inosine editing influences SINE function and how ongoing retrotransposition is countered by the body's defense mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Population differentiation (PD) and ecological association (EA) tests have recently emerged as prominent statistical methods to investigate signatures of local adaptation using population genomic data. Based on statistical models, these genomewide testing procedures have attracted considerable attention as tools to identify loci potentially targeted by natural selection. An important issue with PD and EA tests is that incorrect model specification can generate large numbers of false-positive associations. Spurious association may indeed arise when shared demographic history, patterns of isolation by distance, cryptic relatedness or genetic background are ignored. Recent works on PD and EA tests have widely focused on improvements of test corrections for those confounding effects. Despite significant algorithmic improvements, there is still a number of open questions on how to check that false discoveries are under control and implement test corrections, or how to combine statistical tests from multiple genome scan methods. This tutorial study provides a detailed answer to these questions. It clarifies the relationships between traditional methods based on allele frequency differentiation and EA methods and provides a unified framework for their underlying statistical tests. We demonstrate how techniques developed in the area of genomewide association studies, such as inflation factors and linear mixed models, benefit genome scan methods and provide guidelines for good practice while conducting statistical tests in landscape and population genomic applications. Finally, we highlight how the combination of several well-calibrated statistical tests can increase the power to reject neutrality, improving our ability to infer patterns of local adaptation in large population genomic data sets.},

Many studies examine the sequence diversity within genes, and this allelic variation is an important source of phenotypic variation which can be selected for by man or nature. However, the significant gene presence/absence variation that has been observed within species and the impact of this variation on traits is only now being studied in detail. The sum of the genes for a species is termed the pangenome, and the determination and characterization of the pangenome is a requirement to understand variation within a species.

  abstract = {Structural variations (SVs) are mutations in the genome of size at least fifty nucleotides. They contribute to the phenotypic differences among healthy individuals, cause severe diseases and even cancers by breaking or linking genes. Thus, it is crucial to systematically profile SVs in the genome. In the past decade, many next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based SV detection methods have been proposed due to the significant cost reduction of NGS experiments and their ability to unbiasedly detect SVs to the base-pair resolution. These SV detection methods vary in both sensitivity and specificity, since they use different SV-property-dependent and library-property-dependent features. As a result, predictions from different SV callers are often inconsistent. Besides, the noises in the data (both platform-specific sequencing error and artificial chimeric reads) impede the specificity of SV detection. Poorly characterized regions in the human genome (e.g., repeat regions) greatly impact the reads mapping and in turn affect the SV calling accuracy. Calling of complex SVs requires specialized SV callers. Apart from accuracy, processing speed of SV caller is another factor deciding its usability. Knowing the pros and cons of different SV calling techniques and the objectives of the biological study are essential for biologists and bioinformaticians to make informed decisions. This paper describes different components in the SV calling pipeline and reviews the techniques used by existing SV callers. Through simulation study, we also demonstrate that library properties, especially insert size, greatly impact the sensitivity of different SV callers. We hope the community can benefit from this work both in designing new SV calling methods and in selecting the appropriate SV caller for specific biological studies.},

Sequencing the               N. nucifera               mitochondrial genome is important for elucidating the evolutionary characteristics of basal eudicots. Here, the               N. nucifera               mitochondrial genome was sequenced using single molecule real-time sequencing technology (SMRT) and the mitochondrial genome map was constructed after               de novo               assembly and annotation. The results showed that the 524,797-bp               N. nucifera               mitochondrial genome has a total of 63 genes, including 40 protein-coding genes, three rRNA genes and 20 tRNA genes. Fifteen collinear gene clusters were conserved across different plant species. Approximately 700 RNA editing sites in the protein-coding genes were identified. Positively selected genes were identified with selection pressure analysis. Nineteen chloroplast-derived fragments were identified and seven tRNAs were derived from the chloroplast. These results suggest that the               N. nucifera               mitochondrial genome retains evolutionarily conserved characteristics, including ancient gene content and gene clusters, high levels of RNA editing and low levels of chloroplast-derived fragment insertions. As the first publicly available basal eudicot mitochondrial genome, the               N. nucifera               mitochondrial genome facilitates further analysis of the characteristics of basal eudicots and provides clues of the evolutionary trajectory from basal angiosperms to advanced eudicots.},

  abstract = {Two-locus sampling probabilities have played a central role in devising an efficient composite-likelihood method for estimating fine-scale recombination rates. Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these sampling probabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of a constant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resulting recombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases of historical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop here new methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size functions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implemented in a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the sampling probability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large but sparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes (n \# 50) and demographic size histories with a large number of epochs (D \$ 64). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the sampling probability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size (n \$ 256). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posterior distribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimal proposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we study how a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects the correlation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensive simulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes under such a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scale recombination rate estimation.},

However, de novo scanning of polymorphic TEs remains a challenge. Here, we report a novel computational method, called PTEMD ( polymorphic TEs and their movement detection), for de novo discovery of genome-wide polymorphic TEs. PTEMD searches highly identical sequences using reads supported breakpoint evidences. Using PTEMD, we identified 14 polymorphic TE families (905 sequences) in rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, and 68 (10,618 sequences) in maize. We validated one polymorphic TE family experimentally, MoTE-1; all MoTE-1 family members are located in different genomic loci in the three tested isolates. We found that 57.1\% (8 of 14) of the PTEMD-detected polymorphic TE families in M. oryzae are active. Furthermore, our data indicate that there are more polymorphic DNA transposons in maize than their counterparts of retrotransposons despite the fact that retrotransposons occupy largest fraction of genomic mass. We demonstrated that PTEMD is an effective tool for identifying polymorphic TEs in M. oryzae and maize genomes. PTEMD and the genome-wide polymorphic TEs in M. oryzae and maize are publically available at http://www.kanglab.cn/blast/PTEMD\_V1.02.htm.},

We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

One reason is that TE abundance needs to be studied at the population level, but sequencing individuals on a population scale is still too expensive to characterize TE abundance in multiple populations. Although sequencing pools of individuals dramatically reduces sequencing costs, a comparison of TE abundance between pooled samples has been difficult, if not impossible, due to various biases. Here, we introduce a novel bioinformatic tool, PoPoolationTE2, which is specifically tailored for the comparison of TE abundance among pooled population samples or different tissues. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that PoPoolationTE2 not only faithfully recovers TE insertion frequencies and positions but, by homogenizing the power to identify TEs across samples, it provides an unbiased comparison of TE abundance between pooled population samples. We anticipate that PoPoolationTE2 will greatly facilitate the analysis of TE insertion patterns in a broad range of applications.

In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on omics and clinical data integration techniques, from a machine learning perspective, for various analyses such as prediction, clustering, dimension reduction and association. We shall show that Bayesian models are able to use prior information and model measurements with various distributions; tree-based methods can either build a tree with all features or collectively make a final decision based on trees learned from each view; kernel methods fuse the similarity matrices learned from individual views together for a final similarity matrix or learning model; network-based fusion methods are capable of inferring direct and indirect associations in a heterogeneous network; matrix factorization models have potential to learn interactions among features from different views; and a range of deep neural networks can be integrated in multi-modal learning for capturing the complex mechanism of biological systems.},

  abstract = {Background: Reproductive division of labor in eusocial insects is a striking example of a shared genetic background giving rise to alternative phenotypes, namely queen and worker castes. Queen and worker phenotypes play major roles in the evolution of eusocial insects. Their behavior, morphology and physiology underpin many ecologically relevant colony-level traits, which evolved in parallel in multiple species. Results: Using queen and worker transcriptomic data from 16 ant species we tested the hypothesis that conserved sets of genes are involved in ant reproductive division of labor. We further hypothesized that such sets of genes should also be involved in the parallel evolution of other key traits. We applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis, which clusters co-expressed genes into modules, whose expression levels can be summarized by their `eigengenes'. Eigengenes of most modules were correlated with phenotypic differentiation between queens and workers. Furthermore, eigengenes of some modules were correlated with repeated evolution of key phenotypes such as complete worker sterility, the number of queens per colony, and even invasiveness. Finally, connectivity and expression levels of genes within the co-expressed network were strongly associated with the strength of selection. Although caste-associated sets of genes evolve faster than non-caste-associated, we found no evidence for queen- or worker-associated co-expressed genes evolving faster than one another. Conclusions: These results identify conserved functionally important genomic units that likely serve as building blocks of phenotypic innovation, and allow the remarkable breadth of parallel evolution seen in ants, and possibly other eusocial insects as well.},

  abstract = {Colour is one of the most obvious advertisements of flowers, and occurs in a huge diversity among the angiosperms. Flower colour is responsible for attraction from a distance, whereas contrasting colour patterns within flowers aid orientation of flower visitors after approaching the flowers. Due to the striking differences in colour vision systems and neural processing across animal taxa, flower colours evoke specific behavioural responses by different flower visitors. We tested whether and how yellow flowers differ in their spectral reflectance depending on the main pollinator. We focused on bees and birds and examined whether the presence or absence of the widespread UV reflectance pattern of yellow flowers predicts the main pollinator. Most bee-pollinated flowers displayed a pattern with UV-absorbing centres and UV-reflecting peripheries, whereas the majority of bird-pollinated flowers are entirely UVabsorbing. In choice experiments we found that bees did not show consistent preferences for any colour or pattern types. However, all tested bee species made their first antennal contact preferably at the UV-absorbing area of the artificial flower, irrespective of its spatial position within the flower. The appearance of UV patterns within flowers is the main difference in spectral reflectance between yellow bee- and bird-pollinated flowers, and affects the foraging behaviour of flower visitors. The results support the hypothesis that flower colours and the visual capabilities of their efficient pollinators are adapted to each other.},

A useful methodological framework for this purpose is F-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.},

A genotype network is a graph whose nodes are genotypes (DNA sequences) with the same broadly defined phenotype. Two nodes are connected if they differ in some minimal way, e.g., in a single nucleotide. Results: We analyze human genome variation data from the 1,000 genomes project, and construct haploid genotype (haplotype) networks for 12,235 protein coding genes. The structure of these networks varies widely among genes, indicating different patterns of variation despite a shared evolutionary history. We focus on those genes whose genotype networks show many cycles, which can indicate homoplasy, i.e., parallel or convergent evolution, on the sequence level. Conclusion: For 42 genes, the observed number of cycles is so large that it cannot be explained by either chance homoplasy or recombination. When analyzing possible explanations, we discovered evidence for positive selection in 21 of these genes and, in addition, a potential role for constrained variation and purifying selection. Balancing selection plays at most a small role. The 42 genes with excess cycles are enriched in functions related to immunity and response to pathogens. Genotype networks are representations of genetic variation data that can help understand unusual patterns of genomic variation.},

Recently, a number of computational methods for the detection of polymorphic TE (polyTE) insertion sites from nextgeneration sequence data have been developed. The use of such tools will become increasingly important as the pace of human genome sequencing accelerates. For this report, we performed a comparative benchmarking and validation analysis of polyTE detection tools in an effort to inform their selection and use by the TE research community. We analyzed a core set of seven tools with respect to ease of use and accessibility, polyTE detection performance and runtime parameters. An experimentally validated set of 893 human polyTE insertions was used for this purpose, along with a series of simulated data sets that allowed us to assess the impact of sequence coverage on tool performance. The recently developed tool MELT showed the best overall performance followed by Mobster and then RetroSeq. PolyTE detection tools can best detect Alu insertion events in the human genome with reduced reliability for L1 insertions and substantially lowered performance for SVA insertions. We also show evidence that different polyTE detection tools are complementary with respect to their ability to detect a complete set of insertion events. Accordingly, a combined approach, coupled with manual inspection of individual results, may yield the best overall performance. In addition to the benchmarking results, we also provide notes on tool installation and usage as well as suggestions for future polyTE detection algorithm development.},

  abstract = {Significance             The maize genome, similar to those of most plant genomes, is 98\% noncoding. Much of the remainder is a vast desert of repeats that remain repressed throughout the cell cycle. The plant cell orchestrates its complex activities by restricting access to functional regions with an open chromatin configuration. Here, we identify the small portion ({$<$}1\%) of the maize genome residing in open chromatin. We demonstrate that open chromatin predicts molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and recombination. Furthermore, we show that genetic variation within open chromatin regions accounts for {$\sim$}40\% of phenotypic variation in agronomic traits. By greatly narrowing the scope of the functional maize genome, this study can help to accelerate the pace of crop improvement through highly focused genomic selection and genome editing.           ,              Cellular processes mediated through nuclear DNA must contend with chromatin. Chromatin structural assays can efficiently integrate information across diverse regulatory elements, revealing the functional noncoding genome. In this study, we use a differential nuclease sensitivity assay based on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion to discover open chromatin regions in the maize genome. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks. Although MNase HS regions map to less than 1\% of the genome, they consistently explain a remarkably large amount ({$\sim$}40\%) of heritable phenotypic variance in diverse complex traits. MNase HS regions are therefore on par with coding sequences as annotations that demarcate the functional parts of the maize genome. These results imply that less than 3\% of the maize genome (coding and MNase HS regions) may give rise to the overwhelming majority of phenotypic variation, greatly narrowing the scope of the functional genome.},

To obtain genome-wide map of ZFSs, Zaa with two Z-DNA-binding domains was used for ChIP-Seq analysis. A total of 391 ZFSs were found and their functions were examined in vivo. A large portion of ZFSs was enriched in the promoter regions and contain sequences with high potential to form Z-DNA. Genes containing ZFSs were occupied by RNA polymerase II at the promoters and showed high levels of expression. Moreover, ZFSs were significantly related to active histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. The association of Z-DNA with active transcription was confirmed by the reporter assay system. Overall, our results suggest that Z-DNA formation depends on chromatin structure as well as sequence composition, and is associated with active transcription in human cells. The global information about ZFSs positioning will provide a useful resource for further understanding of DNA structure-dependent transcriptional regulation.},

Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Many common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation.},

  abstract = {Significance             Large-scale initiatives toward personalized medicine are driving a massive expansion in the number of human genomes being sequenced. Therefore, there is an urgent need to define quality standards for clinical use. This includes deep coverage and sequencing accuracy of an individual's genome. Our work represents the largest effort to date in sequencing human genomes at deep coverage with these new standards. This study identifies over 150 million human variants, a majority of them rare and unknown. Moreover, these data identify sites in the genome that are highly intolerant to variation\textemdash possibly essential for life or health. We conclude that high-coverage genome sequencing provides accurate detail on human variation for discovery and clinical applications.           ,              We report on the sequencing of 10,545 human genomes at 30\texttimes\textendash 40\texttimes{} coverage with an emphasis on quality metrics and novel variant and sequence discovery. We find that 84\% of an individual human genome can be sequenced confidently. This high-confidence region includes 91.5\% of exon sequence and 95.2\% of known pathogenic variant positions. We present the distribution of over 150 million single-nucleotide variants in the coding and noncoding genome. Each newly sequenced genome contributes an average of 8,579 novel variants. In addition, each genome carries on average 0.7 Mb of sequence that is not found in the main build of the hg38 reference genome. The density of this catalog of variation allowed us to construct high-resolution profiles that define genomic sites that are highly intolerant of genetic variation. These results indicate that the data generated by deep genome sequencing is of the quality necessary for clinical use.},

With the increasing availability of genome data made possible through next-generation sequencing technology, there is a growing need for user-friendly tools capable of assessing synteny. Here we present SimpleSynteny, a new web-based platform capable of directly interrogating collinearity of local genomic neighbors across multiple species in a targeted manner. SimpleSynteny provides a pipeline for evaluating the synteny of a preselected set of gene targets across multiple organismal genomes. An emphasis has been placed on ease-of-use, and users are only required to submit FASTA files for their genomes and genes of interest. SimpleSynteny then guides the user through an iterative process of exploring and customizing genomes individually before combining them into a final high-resolution figure. Because the process is iterative, it allows the user to customize the organization of multiple contigs and incorporate knowledge from additional sources, rather than forcing complete dependence on the computational predictions. Additional tools are provided to help the user identify which contigs in a genome assembly contain gene targets and to optimize analyses of circular genomes.

One type of analysis that is commonly performed is to estimate local recombination rates and identify recombination hotspots from patterns of LD. One method for detecting recombination hotspots, LDhot, has been used in a handful of species to further our understanding of the basic biology of recombination. For the most part, the effectiveness of this method (e.g., power and false positive rate) is unknown. In this study, we run extensive simulations to compare the effectiveness of three different implementations of LDhot. We find large differences in the power and false positive rates of these different approaches, as well as a strong sensitivity to the window size used (with smaller window sizes leading to more accurate estimation of hotspot locations). We also compared our LDhot simulation results with comparable simulation results obtained from a Bayesian maximum-likelihood approach for identifying hotspots. Surprisingly, we found that the latter computationally intensive approach had substantially lower power over the parameter values considered in our simulations.},

Networks in which nodes are genes connected on the basis of highly correlated expression patterns of mRNAs were very different from networks that were based on coexpression of proteins. Roughly 85\% of highly interconnected hubs were not conserved in expression between RNA and protein networks. However, networks from either data type were enriched in similar ontological categories and were effective in predicting known regulatory relationships. Integration of mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein data sets greatly improved the predictive power of GRNs.},

  abstract = {Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing is an effective strategy for genome-wide association studies in humans, due to the availability of large reference panels for genotype imputation. However, it is unclear whether this strategy can be utilized in other species without reference panels. Using simulations, we show that this approach is even more relevant in inbred species such as rice (Oryza sativa L.), which are effectively haploid, allowing easy haplotype construction and imputation-based genotype calling, even without the availability of large reference panels. We sequenced 203 rice varieties with well-characterized phenotypes from the United States Department of Agriculture Rice Mini-Core Collection at an average depth of 1.53 and used the data for mapping three traits. For the first two traits, amylose content and seed length, our approach leads to direct identification of the previously identified causal SNPs in the major-effect loci. For the third trait, pericarp color, an important trait underwent selection during domestication, we identified a new major-effect locus. Although known loci can explain color variation in the varieties of two main subspecies of Asian domesticated rice, japonica and indica, the new locus identified is unique to another domesticated rice subgroup, aus, and together with existing loci, can fully explain the major variation in pericarp color in aus. Our discovery of a unique genetic basis of white pericarp in aus provides an example of convergent evolution during rice domestication and suggests that aus may have a domestication history independent of japonica and indica.

  abstract = {Background: Waterlily (Nymphaea spp.), a perennial herbaceous aquatic plant, is divided into two ecological groups: hardy waterlily and tropical waterlily. Although the hardy waterlily has no attractive blue flower cultivar, its adaptability is stronger than tropical waterlily because it can survive a cold winter. Thus, breeding hardy waterlily with real blue flowers has become an important target for breeders. Molecular breeding may be a useful way. However, molecular studies on waterlily are limited due to the lack of sequence data. Results: In this study, six cDNA libraries generated from the petals of two different coloring stages of blue tropical waterlily cultivar Nymphaea `King of Siam' were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq\texttrademark{} 2500 platform. Each library produced no less than 5.65 Gb clean reads. Subsequently, de novo assembly generated 112,485 unigenes, including 26,206 unigenes annotated to seven public protein databases. Then, 127 unigenes could be identified as putative homologues of color-related genes in other species, including 28 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated unigenes. In petals, 16 flavonoids (4 anthocyanins and 12 flavonols) were detected in different contents during the color development due to the different expression levels of color-related genes, and four flavonols were detected in waterlily for the first time. Furthermore, UA3GTs were selected as the most important candidates involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway, UA3GTs induced blue petal color formation in Nymphaea `King of Siam'. Conclusions: This study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of blue flowers in waterlily and provide the basis for molecular breeding of blue hardy waterlily cultivars.},

Analysis of simulation data showed that this method outperforms existing methods. We apply this algorithm to low coverage whole-genome sequencing data from peripheral blood of nearly a thousand patients across eleven cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify cancer-predisposing CNV regions. We confirm known regions and discover new ones including those covering KMT2C, GOLPH3, ERBB2 and PLAG1. Analysis of colorectal cancer genomes in particular reveals novel recurrent CNVs including deletions at two chromatin-remodeling genes RERE and NPM2. This method will be useful to many researchers interested in profiling CNVs from whole-genome sequencing data.},

(sacred lotus) is a phylogenetic relict and an aquatic perennial basal eudicot. Studies concerning the centromeres of this basal eudicot species could provide ancient evolutionary perspectives. In this study, we characterized the centromeric marker protein NnCenH3 (sacred lotus centromere-specific histone H3 variant), and used a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based technique to recover the NnCenH3 nucleosome-associated sequences of sacred lotus. The properties of the centromerebinding protein and DNA sequences revealed notable divergence between sacred lotus and other flowering plants, including the following factors: (i) an NnCenH3 alternative splicing variant comprising only a partial centromere-targeting domain, (ii) active genes with low transcription levels in the NnCenH3 nucleosomal regions, and (iii) the prevalence of the Ty1/copia class of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in the centromeres of sacred lotus chromosomes. In addition, the dynamic natures of the centromeric region showed that some of the centromeric repeat DNA sequences originated from telomeric repeats, and a pair of centromeres on the dicentric chromosome 1 was inactive in the metaphase cells of sacred lotus. Our characterization of the properties of centromeric DNA structure within the sacred lotus genome describes a centromeric profile in ancient basal eudicots and might provide evidence of the origins and evolution of centromeres. Furthermore, the identification of centromeric DNA sequences is of great significance for the assembly of the sacred lotus genome.},

  abstract = {Background: The majority of eukaryotic genomes are unfinished due to the algorithmic challenges of assembling them. A variety of assembly and scaffolding tools are available, but it is not always obvious which tool or parameters to use for a specific genome size and complexity. It is, therefore, common practice to produce multiple assemblies using different assemblers and parameters, then select the best one for public release. A more compelling approach would allow one to merge multiple assemblies with the intent of producing a higher quality consensus assembly, which is the objective of assembly reconciliation. Results: Several assembly reconciliation tools have been proposed in the literature, but their strengths and weaknesses have never been compared on a common dataset. We fill this need with this work, in which we report on an extensive comparative evaluation of several tools. Specifically, we evaluate contiguity, correctness, coverage, and the duplication ratio of the merged assembly compared to the individual assemblies provided as input. Conclusions: None of the tools we tested consistently improved the quality of the input GAGE and synthetic assemblies. Our experiments show an increase in contiguity in the consensus assembly when the original assemblies already have high quality. In terms of correctness, the quality of the results depends on the specific tool, as well as on the quality and the ranking of the input assemblies. In general, the number of misassemblies ranges from being comparable to the best of the input assembly to being comparable to the worst of the input assembly.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing, a mechanism of post-transcriptional RNA processing whereby a single gene can encode multiple distinct transcripts, has been proposed to underlie morphological innovations in multicellular organisms. Genes with developmental functions are enriched for alternative splicing events, suggestive of a contribution of alternative splicing to developmental programmes. The role of alternative splicing as a source of transcript diversification has previously been compared to that of gene duplication, with the relationship between the two extensively explored. Alternative splicing is reduced following gene duplication with the retention of duplicate copies higher for genes which were alternatively spliced prior to duplication. Furthermore, and unlike the case for overall gene number, the proportion of alternatively spliced genes has also increased in line with the evolutionary diversification of cell types, suggesting alternative splicing may contribute to the complexity of developmental programmes. Together these observations suggest a prominent role for alternative splicing as a source of functional innovation. However, it is unknown whether the proliferation of alternative splicing events indeed reflects a functional expansion of the transcriptome or instead results from weaker selection acting on larger species, which tend to have a higher number of cell types and lower population sizes.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for BMD have identified dozens of associations; yet, the genes responsible for most associations remain elusive. Here, we used a bone co-expression network to predict causal genes at BMD GWAS loci based on the premise that genes underlying a disease are often functionally related and functionally related genes are often coexpressed. By mapping genes implicated by BMD GWAS onto a bone co-expression network, we predicted and inferred the function of causal genes for 30 of 64 GWAS loci. We experimentally confirmed that two of the genes predicted to be causal, SPTBN1 and MARK3, are potentially responsible for the effects of GWAS loci on chromosomes 2p16.2 and 14q32.32, respectively. This approach provides a roadmap for the dissection of additional BMD GWAS associations. Furthermore, it should be applicable to GWAS data for a wide range of diseases.},

  abstract = {The identification of genomic rearrangements with high sensitivity and specificity using massively parallel sequencing remains a major challenge, particularly in precision medicine and cancer research. Here, we describe a new method for detecting rearrangements, GRIDSS (Genome Rearrangement IDentification Software Suite). GRIDSS is a multithreaded structural variant (SV) caller that performs efficient genome-wide break-end assembly prior to variant calling using a novel positional de Bruijn graph-based assembler. By combining assembly, split read, and read pair evidence using a probabilistic scoring, GRIDSS achieves high sensitivity and specificity on simulated, cell line, and patient tumor data, recently winning SV subchallenge \#5 of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM8.5 Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge. On human cell line data, GRIDSS halves the false discovery rate compared to other recent methods while matching or exceeding their sensitivity. GRIDSS identifies nontemplate sequence insertions, microhomologies, and large imperfect homologies, estimates a quality score for each breakpoint, stratifies calls into high or low confidence, and supports multisample analysis.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Several examples of structural variation (SV) affecting phenotypic traits have been reported in cattle. Currently the identification of SV from whole-genome sequence data (WGS) suffers from a high false positive rate. Our aim was to construct a high quality set of SV calls in cattle using WGS data. First, we tested two SV detection programs, Breakdancer and Pindel, and the overlap of these methods, on simulated sequence data to determine their precision and sensitivity. We then identified population SV from WGS of 252 Holstein and 64 Jersey bulls based on the overlapping calls from the two programs. In addition, we validated an overlapped SV set in 28 twice-sequenced Holstein individuals, and in another two validated sets (one for each breed) that were transmitted from sire to son. We also tested whether highly conserved gene sets across eukaryotes and recently expanded gene families in bovine were depleted and enriched, respectively, for SV. Results:\hspace{0.6em} In empirical WGS data, 17,518 SV covering 27.36 Mb were found in the Holstein population and 4285 SV covering 8.74 Mb in the Jersey population, of which 4.62 Mb of SV overlapped between Holsteins and Jerseys. A total of 11,534 candidate SV covering 5.64 Mb were validated in the 28 twice-sequenced individuals, while 3.49 and 0.67 Mb of SV were validated from Holstein and Jersey sire-son transmission, respectively. Only eight of 237 core eukaryotic genes had at least a 50-bp overlap with an SV from our validated sets, suggesting that conserved genes are depleted for SV (p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, we observed that recently expanded gene families were significantly more associated with SV than other genes. Long interspersed nuclear elements-1 were enriched for deletions when compared to the rest of the genome (p = 0.0035). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} We reported SV from 252 Holstein and 64 Jersey individuals. A considerable proportion of Jersey population SV (53.5\%) were also found in Holstein. In contrast, about 76.90\% sire-son transmission validated SV were present in Jerseys and Holsteins. The enrichment of SV in expanding gene families suggests that SV can be a source of genetic variation for evolution.},

  abstract = {Background               Transposable element (TE) polymorphisms are important components of population genetic variation. The functional impacts of TEs in gene regulation and generating genetic diversity have been observed in multiple species, but the frequency and magnitude of TE variation is under appreciated. Inexpensive and deep sequencing technology has made it affordable to apply population genetic methods to whole genomes with methods that identify single nucleotide and insertion/deletion polymorphisms. However, identifying TE polymorphisms, particularly transposition events or non-reference insertion sites can be challenging due to the repetitive nature of these sequences, which hamper both the sensitivity and specificity of analysis tools.                                         Methods               We have developed the tool RelocaTE2 for identification of TE insertion sites at high sensitivity and specificity. RelocaTE2 searches for known TE sequences in whole genome sequencing reads from second generation sequencing platforms such as Illumina. These sequence reads are used as seeds to pinpoint chromosome locations where TEs have transposed. RelocaTE2 detects target site duplication (TSD) of TE insertions allowing it to report TE polymorphism loci with single base pair precision.                                         Results and Discussion               The performance of RelocaTE2 is evaluated using both simulated and real sequence data. RelocaTE2 demonstrate high level of sensitivity and specificity, particularly when the sequence coverage is not shallow. In comparison to other tools tested, RelocaTE2 achieves the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. In particular, RelocaTE2 performs best in prediction of TSDs for TE insertions. Even in highly repetitive regions, such as those tested on rice chromosome 4, RelocaTE2 is able to report up to 95\% of simulated TE insertions with less than 0.1\% false positive rate using 10-fold genome coverage resequencing data. RelocaTE2 provides a robust solution to identify TE insertion sites and can be incorporated into analysis workflows in support of describing the complete genotype from light coverage genome sequencing.},

We argue that the inherent genetic properties of TEs and the conflicting relationships with their hosts facilitate their recruitment for regulatory functions in diverse genomes. We review recent findings supporting the long-standing hypothesis that the waves of TE invasions endured by organisms for eons have catalysed the evolution of gene-regulatory networks. We also discuss the challenges of dissecting and interpreting the phenotypic effect of regulatory activities encoded by TEs in health and disease.},

  abstract = {The pan-genome of a species is defined as the union of all the genes and noncoding sequences found in all its individuals. However, constructing a pan-genome for plants with large genomes is daunting both in sequencing cost and the scale of the required computational analysis. A more affordable alternative is to focus on the genic repertoire by using transcriptomic data. Here, the software GET\_HOMOLOGUES-EST was benchmarked with genomic and RNA-seq data of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes and then applied to the analysis of transcripts from 16 Hordeum vulgare genotypes. The goal was to sample their pan-genomes and classify sequences as core, if detected in all accessions, or accessory, when absent in some of them. The resulting sequence clusters were used to simulate pan-genome growth, and to compile Average Nucleotide Identity matrices that summarize intra-species variation. Although transcripts were found to under-estimate pan-genome size by at least 10\%, we concluded that clusters of expressed sequences can recapitulate phylogeny and reproduce two properties observed in A. thaliana gene models: accessory loci show lower expression and higher non-synonymous substitution rates than core genes. Finally, accessory sequences were observed to preferentially encode transposon components in both species, plus disease resistance genes in cultivated barleys, and a variety of protein domains from other families that appear frequently associated with presence/absence variation in the literature. These results demonstrate that pan-genome analyses are useful to explore germplasm diversity.},

  abstract = {The accumulation and removal of transposable elements (TEs) is a major driver of genome size evolution in eukaryotes. In plants, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) represent the majority of TEs and form most of the nuclear DNA in large genomes. Unequal recombination (UR) between LTRs leads to removal of intervening sequence and formation of solo-LTRs. UR is a major mechanism of LTR-RT removal in many angiosperms, but our understanding of LTR-RTassociated recombination within the large, LTR-RT-rich genomes of conifers is quite limited. We employ a novel readbased methodology to estimate the relative rates of LTR-RT-associated UR within the genomes of four conifer and seven angiosperm species. We found the lowest rates of UR in the largest genomes studied, conifers and the angiosperm maize. Recombination may also resolve as gene conversion, which does not remove sequence, so we analyzed LTR-RT-associated gene conversion events (GCEs) in Norway spruce and six angiosperms. Opposite the trend for UR, we found the highest rates of GCEs in Norway spruce and maize. Unlike previous work in angiosperms, we found no evidence that rates of UR correlate with retroelement structural features in the conifers, suggesting that another process is suppressing UR in these species. Recent results from diverse eukaryotes indicate that heterochromatin affects the resolution of recombination, by favoring gene conversion over crossing-over, similar to our observation of opposed rates of UR and GCEs. Control of LTR-RT proliferation via formation of heterochromatin would be a likely step toward large genomes in eukaryotes carrying high LTR-RT content.},

Higher plants contain three evolutionarily distinct CA families, aCAs, bCAs, and gCAs, where each family is represented by multiple isoforms in all species. Alternative splicing of CA transcripts appears common; consequently, the number of functional CA isoforms in a species may exceed the number of genes. CAs are expressed in numerous plant tissues and in different cellular locations. The most prevalent CAs are those in the chloroplast, cytosol, and mitochondria. This diversity in location is paralleled in the many physiological and biochemical roles that CAs play in plants. In this review, the number and types of CAs in C3, C4, and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants are considered, and the roles of the a and gCAs are briefly discussed. The remainder of the review focuses on plant bCAs and includes the identification of homologs between species using phylogenetic approaches, a consideration of the inter- and intracellular localization of the proteins, along with the evidence for alternative splice forms. Current understanding of bCA tissue-specific expression patterns and what controls them are reviewed, and the physiological roles for which bCAs have been implicated are presented.},

In plants, the exploration of the extent and role of CNVs in resistance against pathogens and pests is just beginning. Since CNVs are likely to be associated with disease resistance in plants, an understanding of the distribution of CNVs could assist in the identification of novel plant disease-resistance genes.

Due to increasing interest in obtaining haplotyperesolved human genomes, a range of new sequencing protocols and technologies have been developed to enable the reconstruction of whole-genome haplotypes. However, existing computational methods designed to handle specific technologies do not scale well on data from different protocols. We describe a new algorithm, HapCUT2, that extends our previous method (HapCUT) to handle multiple sequencing technologies. Using simulations and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from multiple different data types \textendash{} dilution pool sequencing, linked-read sequencing, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, and proximity ligation (Hi-C) sequencing \textendash{} we show that HapCUT2 rapidly assembles haplotypes with best-in-class accuracy for all data types. In particular, HapCUT2 scales well for high sequencing coverage and rapidly assembled haplotypes for two long-read WGS datasets on which other methods struggled. Further, HapCUT2 directly models Hi-C specific error modalities resulting in significant improvements in error rates compared to HapCUT, the only other method that could assemble haplotypes from Hi-C data. Using HapCUT2, haplotype assembly from a 90\texttimes{} coverage whole-genome Hi-C dataset yielded high-resolution haplotypes (78.6\% of variants phased in a single block) with high pairwise phasing accuracy ({$\sim$} 98\% across chromosomes). Our results demonstrate that HapCUT2 is a robust tool for haplotype assembly applicable to data from diverse sequencing technologies.},

The space decomposition is stored and handled with LAR (Linear Algebraic Representation), i.e. with sparse integer arrays, and allows for using cells of a very general type, even non convex and with internal holes. In this paper we discuss the features and the merits of this approach, and describe the goals and the implementation of a software package aiming at providing for simple and efficient computational support of geometric computing with any kind of meshes, using linear algebra tools with sparse matrices. The library is being written in Julia, the novel efficient and parallel language for scientific computing. This software, that is being ported on hybrid architectures (CPU+GPU) of last generation, is yet under development.},

  abstract = {Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent {$\sim$}25\% of all structural variants in human genomes. Moreover, when they disrupt genes, MEIs can influence human traits and diseases. Therefore, MEIs should be fully discovered along with other forms of genetic variation in whole genome sequencing (WGS) projects involving population genetics, human diseases, and clinical genomics. Here, we describe the Mobile Element Locator Tool (MELT), which was developed as part of the 1000 Genomes Project to perform MEI discovery on a population scale. Using both Illumina WGS data and simulations, we demonstrate that MELT outperforms existing MEI discovery tools in terms of speed, scalability, specificity, and sensitivity, while also detecting a broader spectrum of MEI-associated features. Several run modes were developed to perform MEI discovery on local and cloud systems. In addition to using MELT to discover MEIs in modern humans as part of the 1000 Genomes Project, we also used it to discover MEIs in chimpanzees and ancient (Neanderthal and Denisovan) hominids. We detected diverse patterns of MEI stratification across these populations that likely were caused by (1) diverse rates of MEI production from source elements, (2) diverse patterns of MEI inheritance, and (3) the introgression of ancient MEIs into modern human genomes. Overall, our study provides the most comprehensive map of MEIs to date spanning chimpanzees, ancient hominids, and modern humans and reveals new aspects of MEI biology in these lineages. We also demonstrate that MELT is a robust platform for MEI discovery and analysis in a variety of experimental settings.},

In addition to increasing power to detect associated variants, multi-trait methods can also aid our understanding of how different disorders are aetiologically linked by highlighting relevant biological pathways. A plethora of available tools to perform such analyses exists, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this review, we outline some of the currently available methods to conduct multi-trait analyses.

In order to maintain proper gene function, plant genomes have evolved a variety of mechanisms to tolerate the presence of TEs within or near genes. Here, we review our understanding of the interactions between TEs and gene expression in plants by assessing three ways that transposons can influence gene expression. First, there is growing evidence that TE insertions within introns or untranslated regions of genes are often tolerated and have minimal impact on expression level or splicing. However, there are examples in which TE insertions within genes can result in aberrant or novel transcripts. Second, TEs can provide novel alternative promoters, which can lead to new expression patterns or original coding potential of an alternate transcript. Third, TE insertions near genes can influence regulation of gene expression through a variety of mechanisms. For example, TEs may provide novel cis-acting regulatory sites behaving as enhancers or insert within existing enhancers to influence transcript production. Alternatively, TEs may change chromatin modifications in regions near genes, which in turn can influence gene expression levels. Together, the interactions of genes and TEs provide abundant evidence for the role of TEs in changing basic functions within plant genomes beyond acting as latent genomic elements or as simple insertional mutagens.},

In this study, we identified genomic signatures of convergent evolution associated with bamboo eating. Comparative genomic analyses revealed adaptively convergent genes potentially involved with pseudothumb development and essential bamboo nutrient utilization. We also found that the umami taste receptor gene               TAS1R1               has been pseudogenized in both pandas. These findings provide insights into genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic convergence and adaptation to a specialized bamboo diet in both pandas and offer an example of genome-scale analyses for detecting convergent evolution.                        ,                             Phenotypic convergence between distantly related taxa often mirrors adaptation to similar selective pressures and may be driven by genetic convergence. The giant panda (               Ailuropoda melanoleuca               ) and red panda (               Ailurus fulgens               ) belong to different families in the order Carnivora, but both have evolved a specialized bamboo diet and adaptive pseudothumb, representing a classic model of convergent evolution. However, the genetic bases of these morphological and physiological convergences remain unknown. Through de novo sequencing the red panda genome and improving the giant panda genome assembly with added data, we identified genomic signatures of convergent evolution. Limb development genes               DYNC2H1               and               PCNT               have undergone adaptive convergence and may be important candidate genes for pseudothumb development. As evolutionary responses to a bamboo diet, adaptive convergence has occurred in genes involved in the digestion and utilization of bamboo nutrients such as essential amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins. Similarly, the umami taste receptor gene               TAS1R1               has been pseudogenized in both pandas.

In order to understand the extent to which genomic variation occurs in a species, the construction of its pangenome is necessary. The pangenome represents the complete set of genes of a species; it is composed of core genes, which are present in all individuals, and variable genes, which are present only in some individuals. Aside from variations at the gene level, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are also an important form of genetic variation. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with the heritability of SNPs make them ideal markers for genetic analysis of human, animal, and microbial data. SNPs have also been extensively used in crop genetics for association mapping, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, analysis of genetic diversity, and phylogenetic analysis. This review focuses on the use of pangenomes for SNP discovery. It highlights the advantages of using a pangenome rather than a single reference for this purpose. This review also demonstrates how extra information not captured in a single reference alone can be used to provide additional support for linking genotypic data to phenotypic data.},

Downstream applications, including analysis of genomic variation between species, between or within individuals critically depend on robustly assembled sequences. In the span of a single decade, the sequence throughput of leading DNA sequencing instruments has increased drastically, and coupled with established and planned large-scale, personalized medicine initiatives to sequence genomes in the thousands and even millions, the development of efficient, scalable and accurate bioinformatics tools for producing high-quality reference draft genomes is timely. With ABySS 1.0, we originally showed that assembling the human genome using short 50-bp sequencing reads was possible by aggregating the half terabyte of compute memory needed over several computers using a standardized message-passing system (MPI). We present here its redesign, which departs from MPI and instead implements algorithms that employ a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure, to represent a de Bruijn graph and reduce memory requirements. We benchmarked ABySS 2.0 human genome assembly using a Genome in a Bottle data set of 250-bp Illumina paired-end and 6-kbp mate-pair libraries from a single individual. Our assembly yielded a NG50 (NGA50) scaffold contiguity of 3.5 (3.0) Mbp using {$<$}35 GB of RAM. This is a modest memory requirement by today's standards and is often available on a single computer. We also investigate the use of BioNano Genomics and 10x Genomics' Chromium data to further improve the scaffold NG50 (NGA50) of this assembly to 42 (15) Mbp.},

Here, we quantify this variation among 230 offspring of a cross between diverged yeast strains. We measure the adaptability of each offspring genotype, defined as its average rate of adaptation in a specific environmental condition, and analyze the heritability, predictability, and genetic basis of this trait. We find that initial genotype strongly affects adaptability and can alter the genetic basis of future evolution. Initial genotype also affects the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation for fitness in a different environment. This genetic variation in adaptability and pleiotropy is largely determined by initial fitness, according to a rule of declining adaptability with increasing initial fitness, but several individual QTLs also have a significant idiosyncratic role. Our results demonstrate that both adaptability and pleiotropy are complex traits, with extensive heritable differences arising from naturally occurring variation.},

  abstract = {One of the most striking patterns of genome structure is the tight, typically negative, association between transposable elements (TEs) and meiotic recombination rates. While this is a highly recurring feature of eukaryotic genomes, the mechanisms driving correlations between TEs and recombination remain poorly understood, and distinguishing cause versus effect is challenging. Here, we review the evidence for a relation between TEs and recombination, and discuss the underlying evolutionary forces. Evidence to date suggests that overall TE densities correlate negatively with recombination, but the strength of this correlation varies across element types, and the pattern can be reversed. Results suggest that heterogeneity in the strength of selection against ectopic recombination and gene disruption can drive TE accumulation in regions of low recombination, but there is also strong evidence that the regulation of TEs can influence local recombination rates. We hypothesize that TE insertion polymorphism may be important in driving within-species variation in recombination rates in surrounding genomic regions. Furthermore, the interaction between TEs and recombination may create positive feedback, whereby TE accumulation in non-recombining regions contributes to the spread of recombination suppression. Further investigation of the coevolution between recombination and TEs has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of recombination rates and genome structure.

Computational analysis associates these non-B DNAs with particular structures and indicates that they form at locations compatible with an involvement in gene regulation. Further analyses support the notion that non-B DNA structure formation influences the occupancy and positioning of nucleosomes in chromatin. These results suggest that non-B DNAs contribute to the control of a variety of critical cellular and organismal processes.},

  abstract = {Background: Maize was originally domesticated in a tropical environment but is now widely cultivated at temperate latitudes. Temperate and tropical maize populations have diverged both genotypically and phenotypically. Tropical maize lines grown in temperate environments usually exhibit delayed flowering, pollination, and seed set, which reduces their grain yield relative to temperate adapted maize lines. One potential mechanism by which temperate maize may have adapted to a new environment is novel transposable element insertions, which can influence gene regulation. Recent advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to study variation in transposon content and insertion location in large sets of maize lines. Results: In total, 274,408 non-redundant TEs (NRTEs) were identified using resequencing data generated from 83 maize inbred lines. The locations of DNA TEs and copia-superfamily retrotransposons showed significant positive correlations with gene density and genetic recombination rates, whereas gypsy-superfamily retrotransposons showed a negative correlation with these two parameters. Compared to tropical maize, temperate maize had fewer unique NRTEs but higher insertion frequency, lower background recombination rates, and higher linkage disequilibrium, with more NRTEs close to flowering and stress-related genes in the genome. Association mapping demonstrated that the presence/ absence of 48 NRTEs was associated with flowering time and that expression of neighboring genes differed between haplotypes where a NRTE was present or absent. Conclusions: This study suggests that NRTEs may have played an important role in creating the variation in gene regulation that enabled the rapid adaptation of maize to diverse environments.},

It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.},

The interpretation of these cases has differed amongst biologists and philosophers, leading some to reject the utility of heritability estimates altogether. This paper examines the factors that influence causal reasoning when G\textendash E covariance is present, leading to interpretive disagreement between scholars. It argues that the causal intuitions elicited are influenced by concepts of agency and blame-worthiness, and are intimately tied with the conceptual understanding of the phenotype under investigation. By considering a phenotype-specific approach, I provide an account as to why causal ascriptions can differ depending on the interpreter. Phenotypes like intelligence, which have been the primary focus of this debate, are more likely to spark disagreement for the interpretation of G\textendash E covariance cases because the concept and ideas about its `normal development' relatively ill-defined and are a subject of debate. I contend that philosophical disagreement about causal attributions in G\textendash E covariance cases are in essence disagreements regarding how a phenotype should be defined and understood. This moves the debate from one of an ontological flavour concerning objective causal claims, to one concerning the conceptual, normative and semantic dependencies.},

The development of phylogenetic comparative methods has yielded a tool kit for analyzing contemporary patterns by explicitly modeling processes of change in the past, providing neontologists tools for asking questions previously accessible only for select taxa via the fossil record or laboratory experimentation. The comparative approach, however, differs operationally from alternative approaches to studying convergence in that, for studies of only extant species, convergence must be inferred using evolutionary process models rather than being directly measured. As a result, investigation of evolutionary pattern and process cannot be decoupled in comparative studies of convergence, even though such a decoupling could in theory guard against adaptationist bias. Assumptions about evolutionary process underlying comparative tools can shape the inference of convergent pattern in sometimes profound ways and can color interpretation of such patterns. We discuss these issues and other limitations common to most phylogenetic comparative approaches and suggest ways that they can be avoided in practice. We conclude by promoting a multipronged approach to studying convergence that integrates comparative methods with complementary tests of evolutionary mechanisms and includes ecological and biogeographical perspectives. Carefully employed, the comparative method remains a powerful tool for enriching our understanding of convergence in macroevolution, especially for investigation of why convergence occurs in some settings but not others.},

  abstract = {Only a small percentage of the genome sequence is involved in regulation of gene expression, but to biochemically identify this portion is expensive and laborious. In species like maize, with diverse intergenic regions and lots of repetitive elements, this is an especially challenging problem. While regulatory regions are rare, they do have characteristic chromatin contexts and sequence organization (the grammar) with which they can be identified. We developed a computational framework to exploit this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify regulatory regions based on sequence features - k-mers. To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing: (1) ``bag-of-words'' which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built ``bag-of-k-mers'' and ``vector-k-mers'' models that distinguish between regulatory and nonregulatory regions with an accuracy above 90\%. Our ``bag-of-k-mers'' achieved higher overall accuracy, while the ``vector-k-mers'' models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. These models now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Advances in sequencing and genotyping methods have enable cost-effective production of high throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, making them the choice for linkage mapping. As a result, many laboratories have developed high-throughput SNP assays and built high-density genetic maps. However, the number of markers may, by orders of magnitude, exceed the resolution of recombination for a given population size so that only a minority of markers can accurately be ordered. Another issue attached to the so-called `large p, small n' problem is that high-density genetic maps inevitably result in many markers clustering at the same position (cosegregating markers). While there are a number of related papers, none have addressed the impact of co-segregating markers on genetic maps. In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-segregating markers on high-density genetic map length and marker order using empirical data from two populations of wheat, Mohawk \texttimes{} Cocorit (durum wheat) and Norstar \texttimes{} Cappelle Desprez (bread wheat). The maps of both populations consisted of 85\% co-segregating markers. Our study clearly showed that excess of co-segregating markers can lead to map expansion, but has little effect on markers order. To estimate the inflation factor (IF), we generated a total of 24,473 linkage maps (8,203 maps for Mohawk \texttimes{} Cocorit and 16,270 maps for Norstar \texttimes{} Cappelle Desprez). Using seven machine learning algorithms, we were able to predict with an accuracy of 0.7 the map expansion due to the proportion of co-segregating markers. For example in Mohawk \texttimes{} Cocorit, with 10 and 80\% co-segregating markers the length of the map inflated by 4.5 and 16.6\%, respectively. Similarly, the map of Norstar \texttimes{} Cappelle Desprez expanded by 3.8 and 11.7\% with 10 and 80\% co-segregating markers. With the increasing number of markers on SNP-chips, the proportion of co-segregating markers in high-density maps will continue to increase making map expansion unavoidable. Therefore, we suggest developers improve linkage mapping algorithms for efficient analysis of high-throughput data. This study outlines a practical strategy to estimate the IF due to the proportion of co-segregating markers and outlines a method to scale the length of the map accordingly.},

Adding this missing variation results in a structure that can be described as a mathematical graph: a genome graph. We demonstrate that, in comparison to the existing reference genome (GRCh38), genome graphs can substantially improve the fractions of reads that map uniquely and perfectly. Furthermore, we show that this fundamental simplification of read mapping transforms the variant calling problem from one in which many non-reference variants must be discovered de-novo to one in which the vast majority of variants are simply reidentified within the graph. Using standard benchmarks as well as a novel reference-free evaluation, we show that a simplistic variant calling procedure on a genome graph can already call variants at least as well as, and in many cases better than, a state-of-the-art method on the linear human reference genome. We anticipate that graph-based references will supplant linear references in humans and in other applications where cohorts of sequenced individuals are available.},

  abstract = {Background: While most cells in multicellular organisms carry the same genetic information, in each cell type only a subset of genes is being transcribed. Such differentiation in gene expression depends, for a large part, on the activation and repression of regulatory sequences, including transcriptional enhancers. Transcriptional enhancers can be located tens of kilobases from their target genes, but display characteristic chromatin and DNA features, allowing their identification by genome-wide profiling. Here we show that integration of chromatin characteristics can be applied to predict distal enhancer candidates in Zea mays, thereby providing a basis for a better understanding of gene regulation in this important crop plant. Result: To predict transcriptional enhancers in the crop plant maize (Zea mays L. ssp. mays), we integrated available genome-wide DNA methylation data with newly generated maps for chromatin accessibility and histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) enrichment in young seedling and husk tissue. Approximately 1500 intergenic regions, displaying low DNA methylation, high chromatin accessibility and H3K9ac enrichment, were classified as enhancer candidates. Based on their chromatin profiles, candidate sequences can be classified into four subcategories. Tissue-specificity of enhancer candidates is defined based on the tissues in which they are identified and putative target genes are assigned based on tissue-specific expression patterns of flanking genes. Conclusions: Our method identifies three previously identified distal enhancers in maize, validating the new set of enhancer candidates and enlarging the toolbox for the functional characterization of gene regulation in the highly repetitive maize genome.},

However, high-density genetic maps of cowpea are still lacking. Here, we identified 34,868 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that were distributed in the cowpea genome based on the RAD sequencing (restriction-site associated DNA sequencing) technique using a population of 170 individuals (two cowpea parents and 168 F2:3 progenies). Of these, 17,996 reliable SNPs were allotted to 11 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The length of the genetic map was 1,194.25 cM in total with a mean distance of 0.066 cM/SNP marker locus. Using this map and the F2:3 population, combined with the CIM (composite interval mapping) method, eleven quantitative trait loci (QTL) of yield-related trait were detected on seven LGs (LG4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11) in cowpea. These QTL explained 0.05\textendash 17.32\% of the total phenotypic variation. Among these, four QTL were for pod length, four QTL for thousand-grain weight (TGW), two QTL for grain number per pod, and one QTL for carpopodium length. Our results will provide a foundation for understanding genes related to grain yield in the cowpea and genus Vigna.},

A large number of small molecules (the so-called ligands), which could bind and modulate the stability of G-quadruplexes structures, have been widely examined. Hitherto, much less is known for the ligand binding interactions with the relatively young C-quadruplex (i-motif). Here by combining steady-state measurements (UV-vis, fluorescence, and ICD) with time-resolved laser flash photolysis spectroscopy, we study the binding interactions of cationic porphyrin (TMPyP4) with imotifs (C3TA2)3C3T and (C4A4C4)2. The intercalation binding mode via - stacking of porphyrin macrocyle and the C:C+ hemiprotonated base-pair has been identified for the first time. The coexisted binding modes of intercalation (\textasciitilde 80\%) versus external major groove binding (\textasciitilde 20\%) are determined quantitatively, allowing a full picture understanding of the porphyrin/i-motif interactions. Ionic strength is found to play important roles affecting the binding modes, with the progressive increase of the ionic strength resulting in gradual decrease of the intercalation percentage and increase of groove binding percentage. Further, extended study for the porphyrin derivative with four bulky side arm substituents (T4), suggests a complete prohibition of the intercalation mode due to large steric hindrance, and thus providing a novel groove-binding ligand with site selectivity. These results provide in-depth mechanistic insights for understanding the ligand interactions with imotifs and guidance for related applications in anticancer drug design.},

However, there is currently no standard method to represent genomic intervals, such as the positions of genes or transcription factor binding sites, on graph-based reference genomes. Results: We formalize offset-based coordinate systems on graph-based reference genomes and introduce methods for representing intervals on these reference structures. We show the advantage of our methods by representing genes on a graph-based representation of the newest assembly of the human genome (GRCh38) and its alternative loci for regions that are highly variable. Conclusion: More complex reference genomes, containing alternative loci, require methods to represent genomic data on these structures. Our proposed notation for genomic intervals makes it possible to fully utilize the alternative loci of the GRCh38 assembly and potential future graph-based reference genomes. We have made a Python package for representing such intervals on offset-based coordinate systems, available at https://github.com/uio-cels/ offsetbasedgraph. An interactive web-tool using this Python package to visualize genes on a graph created from GRCh38 is available at https://github.com/uio-cels/genomicgraphcoords.},

  abstract = {Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where highdimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.},

Even though numerous software have been developed to make sense of large genomics datasets, a major short falling of these has been the inability to cope with repetitive regions, specifically to validate structural variants and accordingly assess their role in disease. Here we describe our program STEAK, a massively parallel software designed to detect chimeric reads in high-throughput sequencing data for a broad number of applications such as identifying presence/absence, as well as discovery of transposable elements (TEs), and retroviral integrations. We highlight the capabilities of STEAK by comparing its efficacy in locating HERV-K HML-2 in clinical whole genome projects, target enrichment sequences, and in the 1000 Genomes CEU Trio to the performance of other TE and virus detecting tools. We show that STEAK outperforms other software in terms of computational efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity. We demonstrate that STEAK is a robust tool, which allows analysts to flexibly detect and evaluate TE and retroviral integrations in a diverse range of sequencing projects for both research and clinical purposes.},

With the progress of sequencing technologies, pan-genome study is becoming affordable for eukaryotes with large-sized genomes. The Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L., is one of the major food sources for the world and a model organism in plant biology. Recently, the 3000 Rice Genome Project (3K RGP) sequenced more than 3000 rice genomes with a mean sequencing depth of 14.3\texttimes, which provided a tremendous resource for rice research. In this paper, we present a genome browser, Rice Pan-genome Browser (RPAN), as a tool to search and visualize the rice pan-genome derived from 3K RGP. RPAN contains a database of the basic information of 3010 rice accessions, including genomic sequences, gene annotations, PAV information and gene expression data of the rice pan-genome. At least 12 000 novel genes absent in the reference genome were included. RPAN also provides multiple search and visualization functions. RPAN can be a rich resource for rice biology and rice breeding. It is available at http://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/3kricedb/ or http://www.rmbreeding.cn/pan3k.},

  abstract = {Estimating temperate adaptation in ancient maize                            Maize as a staple food crop in temperate North America required adaptation to a shorter growing season. On its first introduction in the southwestern United States {$\sim$}4000 years ago, maize was extensively grown in the lowlands. Cultivation in the temperate uplands did not occur for another 2000 years. Swarts               et al.               used ancient DNA data from 1900-year-old maize cobs found in a temperate cave in the southwestern United States and mapped the ancient flowering phenotype. The ancient maize samples were marginally adapted to temperate regions as a result of selection on standing variation.                                         Science               , this issue p.               512                        ,              Archaeological maize found in ancient turkey pens was adapted to temperate environments by 1900 years ago.           ,              By 4000 years ago, people had introduced maize to the southwestern United States; full agriculture was established quickly in the lowland deserts but delayed in the temperate highlands for 2000 years. We test if the earliest upland maize was adapted for early flowering, a characteristic of modern temperate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1900-year-old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the temperate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering, and segregating for yellow kernel color. Temperate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation.},

A number of assumptions are made in using such reasoning, chief among these is that evolution in natural systems is an optimal, or at least best available, search mechanism, and that a decoupling of search space from behaviour encourages effective search. In this paper, we explore these assumptions as they relate to evolutionary algorithms, and discuss philosophical foundations from which an effective evolutionary search can be constructed. This framework is used to examine grammatical evolution (GE), a popular search method that draws heavily upon concepts from molecular biology. We identify several properties in GE that are in direct conflict with those that promote effective evolutionary search. The paper concludes with some recommendations for designing representations for effective evolutionary search.},

A number of SV detection algorithms based on high-throughput sequencing data have been developed, but they have various and often limited level of sensitivity, specificity and breakpoint resolution. Furthermore, since overlaps between predictions of algorithms are low, SV detection based on multiple algorithms, an often-used strategy in real applications, has little effect in improving the performance of SV detection.},

Maize is an ideal crop for GWAS and significant progress has been made in the last decade. This review summarizes current GWAS efforts in maize functional genomics research and discusses future prospects in the omics era. The general goal of GWAS is to link genotypic variations to corresponding differences in phenotype using the most appropriate statistical model in a given population. The current review also presents perspectives for optimizing GWAS design and analysis. GWAS analysis of data from RNA, protein, and metabolite-based omics studies is discussed, along with new models and new population designs that will identify causes of phenotypic variation that have been hidden to date. The joint and continuous efforts of the whole community will enhance our understanding of maize quantitative traits and boost crop molecular breeding designs.},

  abstract = {Background: Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are major components of plant genomes. Common LTR-RTs contain the palindromic dinucleotide 5{${'}$}-`TG'\textendash `CA'-3{${'}$} motif at the ends. Thus, further analyses of noncanonical LTR-RTs with non-palindromic motifs will enhance our understanding of their structures and evolutionary history. Results: Here, we report two new LTR-RT subfamilies (TGTT and AACA) with atypical dinucleotide ends of 5{${'}$}-`TG'\textendash `TT'-3{${'}$}, and 5{${'}$}-`AA'\textendash `CA'-3{${'}$} in pear, apple, peach and mei. In total, 91 intact LTR-RTs were identified and classified into four TGTT and four AACA families. A structural annotation analysis showed that the four TGTT families, together with AACA1 and AACA2, belong to the Copia-like superfamily, whereas AACA3 and AACA4 appeared to be TRIM elements. The average amplification time frames for the eight families ranged from 0.05 to 2.32 million years. Phylogenetics coupled with sequence analyses revealed that the TGTT1 elements of peach were horizontally transferred from apple. In addition, 32 elements from two TGTT and three AACA families had detectable transcriptional activation, and a qRT-PCR analysis indicated that their expression levels varied dramatically in different species, organs and stress treatments. Conclusions: Two novel LTR-RT subfamilies that terminated with non-palindromic dinucleotides at the ends of their LTRs were identified in four Rosaceae species, and a deep analysis showed their recent activity, horizontal transfer and varied transcriptional levels in different species, organs and stress treatments. This work enhances our understanding of the structural variation and evolutionary history of LTR-RTs in plants and also provides a valuable resource for future investigations of LTR-RTs having specific structures in other species.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Active retrotransposons play important roles during evolution and continue to shape our genomes today, especially in genetic polymorphisms underlying a diverse set of diseases. However, studies of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) based on whole-genome deep sequencing at the population level have not been sufficiently undertaken, despite the obvious need for a thorough characterization of RIPs in the general population. Herein, we present a novel and efficient computational tool called Specific Insertions Detector (SID) for the detection of non-reference RIPs. We demonstrate that SID is suitable for high-depth whole-genome sequencing data using paired-end reads obtained from simulated and real datasets. We construct a comprehensive RIP database using a large population of 90 Han Chinese individuals with a mean \texttimes 68 depth per individual. In total, we identify 9342 recent RIPs, and 8433 of these RIPs are novel compared with dbRIP, including 5826 Alu, 2169 long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1), 383 SVA, and 55 long terminal repeats. Among the 9342 RIPs, 4828 were located in gene regions and 5 were located in protein-coding regions. We demonstrate that RIPs can, in principle, be an informative resource to perform population evolution and phylogenetic analyses. Taking the demographic effects into account, we identify a weak negative selection on SVA and L1 but an approximately neutral selection for Alu elements based on the frequency spectrum of RIPs. SID is a powerful open-source program for the detection of non-reference RIPs. We built a non-reference RIP dataset that greatly enhanced the diversity of RIPs detected in the general population, and it should be invaluable to researchers interested in many aspects of human evolution, genetics, and disease. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the RIPs can be used as biomarkers in a similar way as single nucleotide polymorphisms.},

  abstract = {The ability of a population to adapt to changes in their living conditions, whether in nature or captivity, often depends on polymorphisms in multiple genes across the genome. In-depth studies of such polygenic adaptations are difficult in natural populations, but can be approached using the resources provided by artificial selection experiments. Here, we dissect the genetic mechanisms involved in long-term selection responses of the Virginia chicken lines, populations that after 40 generations of divergent selection for 56-day body weight display a 9-fold difference in the selected trait. In the F15 generation of an intercross between the divergent lines, 20 loci explained {$>$}60\% of the additive genetic variance for the selected trait. We focused particularly on fine-mapping seven major QTL that replicated in this population and found that only two fine-mapped to single, bi-allelic loci; the other five contained linked loci, multiple alleles or were epistatic. This detailed dissection of the polygenic adaptations in the Virginia lines provides a deeper understanding of the range of different genome-wide mechanisms that have been involved in these long-term selection responses. The results illustrate that the genetic architecture of a highly polygenic trait can involve a broad range of genetic mechanisms, and that this can be the case even in a small population bred from founders with limited genetic diversity.},

It is a major statistical challenge to detect such adaptive polymorphisms if the confounding is strong, or the effects of the adaptive alleles are weak. Here, we describe a novel approach to dissect polygenic traits in natural populations. First, candidate adaptive loci are identified by screening for loci that are directly associated to the trait or control the expression of genes known to affect it. Then, the multi-locus genetic architecture is inferred using a backward elimination association analysis across all the candidate loci using an adaptive false-discovery rate based threshold. Effects of population stratification are controlled by corrections for population structure in the pre-screening step and by simultaneously testing all candidate loci in the multi-locus model. We illustrate the method by exploring the polygenic basis of an important adaptive trait, flowering time in             Arabidopsis thaliana             , using public data from the 1,001 genomes project. Our method revealed associations between 33 (29) loci and flowering time at 10 (16)\textdegree C in this collection of natural accessions, where standard genome wide association analysis methods detected 5 (3) loci. The 33 (29) loci explained approximately 55 (48)\% of the total phenotypic variance of the respective traits. Our work illustrates how the genetic basis of highly polygenic adaptive traits in natural populations can be explored in much greater detail by using new multi-locus mapping approaches taking advantage of prior biological information as well as genome and transcriptome data.},

CpGenie produces allele-specific DNA methylation prediction with single-nucleotide sensitivity that enables accurate prediction of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). We demonstrate that CpGenie prioritizes validated GWAS SNPs, and contributes to the prediction of functional noncoding variants, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and disease-associated mutations.

Here, we perform a genome-wide comparison of all eight Oryza AA-genome species, and identify 3911 intact LTR retrotransposons classified into 790 families. The top 44 most abundant LTR retrotransposon families show patterns of rapid and distinct diversification since the species split over the last  4.8 MY (million years). Phylogenetic and read depth analyses of 11 representative retrotransposon families further provide a comprehensive evolutionary landscape of these changes. Compared with Ty1-copia, independent bursts of Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon expansions have occurred with the three largest showing signatures of lineage-specific evolution. The estimated insertion times of 2213 complete retrotransposons from the top 23 most abundant families reveal divergent life histories marked by speedy accumulation, decline, and extinction that differed radically between species. We hypothesize that this rapid evolution of LTR retrotransposons not only divergently shaped the architecture of rice genomes but also contributed to the process of speciation and diversification of rice.},

The first is the duration of domestication; archaeological evidence suggests that domestication occurs over millennia, but genetic evidence indicates it can occur rapidly. We estimated that our wild and cultivated grape samples diverged \textasciitilde 22,000 years ago and that the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size (             N                            e                          ) thereafter. The long decline may reflect low intensity management by humans prior to domestication. The second mystery is the identification of genes that contribute to domestication phenotypes. In cultivated grapes, we identified candidate-selected genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development and stress responses. In contrast, candidate selected genes in the wild sample were limited to abiotic and biotic stress responses. A genomic region of high divergence corresponded to the sex determination region and included a candidate male sterility factor and additional genes with sex-specific expression. The third mystery concerns the cost of domestication. Annual crops accumulate putatively deleterious variants, in part due to strong domestication bottlenecks. The domestication of perennial crops differs from annuals in several ways, including the intensity of bottlenecks, and it is not yet clear if they accumulate deleterious variants. We found that grape accessions contained 5.2\% more deleterious variants than wild individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state.

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies exploring sequence variation in the model legume, Medicago truncatula, relied on mapping short reads to a single reference. However, read-mapping approaches are inadequate to examine large, diverse gene families or to probe variation in repeat-rich or highly divergent genome regions. De novo sequencing and assembly of M. truncatula genomes enables near-comprehensive discovery of structural variants (SVs), analysis of rapidly evolving gene families, and ultimately, construction of a pan-genome. Results: Genome-wide synteny based on 15 de novo M. truncatula assemblies effectively detected different types of SVs indicating that as much as 22\% of the genome is involved in large structural changes, altogether affecting 28\% of gene models. A total of 63 million base pairs (Mbp) of novel sequence was discovered, expanding the reference genome space for Medicago by 16\%. Pan-genome analysis revealed that 42\% (180 Mbp) of genomic sequences is missing in one or more accession, while examination of de novo annotated genes identified 67\% (50,700) of all ortholog groups as dispensable \textendash{} estimates comparable to recent studies in rice, maize and soybean. Rapidly evolving gene families typically associated with biotic interactions and stress response were found to be enriched in the accession-specific gene pool. The nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family, in particular, harbors the highest level of nucleotide diversity, large effect single nucleotide change, protein diversity, and presence/ absence variation. However, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and heat shock gene families are disproportionately affected by large effect single nucleotide changes and even higher levels of copy number variation. Conclusions: Analysis of multiple M. truncatula genomes illustrates the value of de novo assemblies to discover and describe structural variation, something that is often under-estimated when using read-mapping approaches. Comparisons among the de novo assemblies also indicate that different large gene families differ in the architecture of their structural variation.},

  abstract = {Long sequencing reads generated by single-molecule sequencing technology offer the possibility of dramatically improving the contiguity of genome assemblies. The biggest challenge today is that long reads have relatively high error rates, currently around 15\%. The high error rates make it difficult to use this data alone, particularly with highly repetitive plant genomes. Errors in the raw data can lead to insertion or deletion errors (indels) in the consensus genome sequence, which in turn create significant problems for downstream analysis; for example, a single indel may shift the reading frame and incorrectly truncate a protein sequence. Here, we describe an algorithm that solves the high error rate problem by combining long, high-error reads with shorter but much more accurate Illumina sequencing reads, whose error rates average {$<$}1\%. Our hybrid assembly algorithm combines these two types of reads to construct               mega-reads               , which are both long and accurate, and then assembles the mega-reads using the CABOG assembler, which was designed for long reads. We apply this technique to a large data set of Illumina and PacBio sequences from the species               Aegilops tauschii               , a large and extremely repetitive plant genome that has resisted previous attempts at assembly. We show that the resulting assembled contigs are far larger than in any previous assembly, with an N50 contig size of 486,807 nucleotides. We compare the contigs to independently produced optical maps to evaluate their large-scale accuracy, and to a set of high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based assemblies to evaluate base-level accuracy.},

  abstract = {Background: Organisms need to adapt to keep pace with a changing environment. Examining recent range expansion aids our understanding of how organisms evolve to overcome environmental constraints. However, how organisms adapt to climate changes is a crucial biological question that is still largely unanswered. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an excellent system to study this fundamental question. Its origin is in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, but it has spread to the Far East, including the most south-eastern edge of its native habitats, the Yangtze River basin, where the climate is very different. Results: We sequenced 118 A. thaliana strains from the region surrounding the Yangtze River basin. We found that the Yangtze River basin population is a unique population and diverged about 61,409 years ago, with gene flows occurring at two different time points, followed by a population dispersion into the Yangtze River basin in the last few thousands of years. Positive selection analyses revealed that biological regulation processes, such as flowering time, immune and defense response processes could be correlated with the adaptation event. In particular, we found that the flowering time gene SVP has contributed to A. thaliana adaptation to the Yangtze River basin based on genetic mapping. Conclusions: A. thaliana adapted to the Yangtze River basin habitat by promoting the onset of flowering, a finding that sheds light on how a species can adapt to locales with very different climates.},

THiCweed clusters bound regions based on sequence similarity using a divisive hierarchical clustering approach based on sequence similarity within sliding windows, while exploring both strands. ThiCweed is specially geared toward data containing mixtures of motifs, which present a challenge to traditional motif-finders. Our implementation is significantly faster than standard motif-finding programs, able to process 30 000 peaks in 1\textendash 2 h, on a single CPU core of a desktop computer. On synthetic data containing mixtures of motifs it is as accurate or more accurate than all other tested programs. THiCweed performs best with large `window' sizes ({$\geq$}50 bp), much longer than typical binding sites (7\textendash 15 bp). On real data it successfully recovers literature motifs, but also uncovers complex sequence characteristics in flanking DNA, variant motifs and secondary motifs even when they occur in {$<$}5\% of the input, all of which appear biologically relevant. We also find recurring sequence patterns across diverse ChIP-seq datasets, possibly related to chromatin architecture and looping. THiCweed thus goes beyond traditional motif finding to give new insights into genomic transcription factor-binding complexity.},

One such receptor is MDA5, a viral dsRNA sensor that induces antiviral immune response. Using a newly developed RNase-protection/RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate here that constitutive activation of MDA5 in AGS results from the loss of tolerance to cellular dsRNAs formed by Alu retroelements. While wildtype MDA5 cannot efficiently recognize Alu-dsRNAs because of its limited filament formation on imperfect duplexes, AGS variants of MDA5 display reduced sensitivity to duplex structural irregularities, assembling signaling-competent filaments on Alu-dsRNAs. Moreover, we identified an unexpected role of an RNA-rich cellular environment in suppressing aberrant MDA5 oligomerization, highlighting context dependence of self versus non-self discrimination. Overall, our work demonstrates that the increased efficiency of MDA5 in recognizing dsRNA comes at a cost of self-recognition and implicates a unique role of Alu-dsRNAs as virus-like elements that shape the primate immune system.},

Despite the frequent use of OA and EAA approaches and their increasing attractiveness for detecting signatures of selection, their application to field-based empirical data have not been synthesized. Here, we review 66 empirical studies that use Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in OA and EAA. We report trends and biases across biological systems, sequencing methods, approaches, parameters, environmental variables and their influence on detecting signatures of selection. We found striking variability in both the use and reporting of environmental data and statistical parameters. For example, linkage disequilibrium among SNPs and numbers of unique SNP associations identified with EAA were rarely reported. The proportion of putatively adaptive SNPs detected varied widely among studies, and decreased with the number of SNPs analysed. We found that genomic sampling effort had a greater impact than biological sampling effort on the proportion of identified SNPs under selection. OA identified a higher proportion of outliers when more individuals were sampled, but this was not the case for EAA. To facilitate repeatability, interpretation and synthesis of studies detecting selection, we recommend that future studies consistently report geographical coordinates, environmental data, model parameters, linkage disequilibrium, and measures of genetic structure. Identifying standards for how OA and EAA studies are designed and reported will aid future transparency and comparability of SNP-based selection studies and help to progress landscape and evolutionary genomics.},

Although existing tools recognize VNTR carrying sequence, genotyping VNTRs (determining repeat unit count and sequence variation) from whole-genome sequencing reads remains challenging. We describe a method, adVNTR, that uses hidden Markov models to model each VNTR, count repeat units, and detect sequence variation. adVNTR models can be developed for short-read (Illumina) and single-molecule (Pacific Biosciences [PacBio]) whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, and show good results on multiple simulated and real data sets.},

These populations are expected to be highly genetically differentiated due to evolutionary history and poor gene flow between ancestral populations from different continents. The extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) impacts the implementation of genome-wide association studies and genomic selection and provides relevant information about demographic processes of fish populations. We assessed the population structure and characterized the extent and decay of LD in three Chilean commercial populations of Atlantic salmon with North American (NAM), Scottish (SCO) and Norwegian (NOR) origin. A total of 151 animals were genotyped using a 159K SNP Axiom\textregistered{} myDesign\texttrademark{} Genotyping Array. A total of 40K, 113K and 136 K SNP markers were used for NAM, SCO and NOR populations, respectively. The principal component analysis explained 86.7\% of the genetic diversity between populations, clearly discriminating between populations of North American and European origin, and also between European populations. Admixture analysis showed that the Scottish and North American populations likely come from one ancestral population, while the Norwegian population probably originated from more than one. NAM had the lowest effective size, followed by SCO and NOR. Large differences in the LD decay were observed between populations of North American and European origin. A r             2             threshold of 0.2 was estimated for marker pairs separated by 8,000 Kb, 42 and 64 Kb in the NAM, NOR and SCO populations, respectively. In this study we show that this SNP panel can be used to detect association between markers and traits of interests and also to capture high-resolution information for genome-enabled predictions. Also, we suggest the feasibility to achieve higher prediction accuracies by using a small SNP data set as was used with the NAM population.},

Here we investigate parallel changes in intraspecific genome size and repeat content of domesticated maize (Zea mays) landraces and their wild relative teosinte across altitudinal gradients in Mesoamerica and South America. We combine genotyping, low coverage whole-genome sequence data, and flow cytometry to test for evidence of selection on genome size and individual repeat abundance. We find that population structure alone cannot explain the observed variation, implying that clinal patterns of genome size are maintained by natural selection. Our modeling additionally provides evidence of selection on individual heterochromatic knob repeats, likely due to their large individual contribution to genome size. To better understand the phenotypes driving selection on genome size, we conducted a growth chamber experiment using a population of highland teosinte exhibiting extensive variation in genome size. We find weak support for a positive correlation between genome size and cell size, but stronger support for a negative correlation between genome size and the rate of cell production. Reanalyzing published data of cell counts in maize shoot apical meristems, we then identify a negative correlation between cell production rate and flowering time. Together, our data suggest a model in which variation in genome size is driven by natural selection on flowering time across altitudinal clines, connecting intraspecific variation in repetitive sequence to important differences in adaptive phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive effort to reveal the genetic basis of complex phenotypic variation, studies typically explain only a fraction of trait heritability. It has been hypothesized that individually rare hidden structural variants (SVs) could account for a significant fraction of variation in complex traits. To investigate this hypothesis, we assembled 14 Drosophila melanogaster genomes and systematically identified more than 20,000 euchromatic SVs, of which \textasciitilde 40\% are invisible to high specificity short read genotyping approaches. SVs are common in Drosophila genes, with almost one third of diploid individuals harboring an SV in genes larger than 5kb, and nearly a quarter harboring multiple SVs in genes larger than 10kb. We show that SV alleles are rarer than amino acid polymorphisms, implying that they are more strongly deleterious. A number of functionally important genes harbor previously hidden structural variants that likely affect complex phenotypes (e.g., Cyp6g1, Drsl5, Cyp28d1\&2, InR, and Gss1\&2). Furthermore, SVs are overrepresented in quantitative trait locus candidate genes from eight Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) mapping experiments. We conclude that SVs are pervasive in genomes, are frequently present as heterogeneous allelic series, and can act as rare alleles of large effect.},

  abstract = {More than 8\% of the human genome is derived from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). In recent years more and more polymorphic (unfixed) ERVs were found to be associated with human diseases. However, it is still challenging to accurately detect polymorphic ERVs using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) data. As such, development of new tools is needed to rectify this shortcoming. We designed a new tool, ERVcaller, to accurately detect and genotype nonreference unfixed transposable elements (TEs), including ERVs, in the human genome. We evaluated the tool using both simulated and real benchmark whole-genome sequencing datasets. The detection power and precision were \textasciitilde 98\% and \textasciitilde 99\%, respectively, and the genotyping accuracy was \textasciitilde 97\% under 30X sequencing depth. We compared ERVcaller with four existing tools. ERVcaller consistently showed the highest sensitivity and precision for detecting and genotyping non-reference unfixed TEs, particularly ERVs, as well as produce the most accurate breakpoints at single nucleotide resolution, especially under low sequencing depths. By applying ERVcaller to the 1000 Genomes Project samples, we detected 100\% of the ERVs and 95\% of the TEs that were experimentally validated. In conclusion, ERVcaller is capable of accurately identifying and genotyping non-reference unfixed ERVs and other TEs using NGS data.},

  abstract = {Bayesian multiple-regression methods incorporating different mixture priors for marker effects are used widely in genomic prediction. Improvement in prediction accuracies from using those methods, such as BayesB, BayesC, and BayesCp, have been shown in single-trait analyses with both simulated and real data. These methods have been extended to multi-trait analyses, but only under the restrictive assumption that a locus simultaneously affects all the traits or none of them. This assumption is not biologically meaningful, especially in multi-trait analyses involving many traits. In this paper, we develop and implement a more general multitrait BayesCP and BayesB methods allowing a broader range of mixture priors. Our methods allow a locus to affect any combination of traits, e.g., in a 5-trait analysis, the ``restrictive'' model only allows two situations, whereas ours allow all 32 situations. Further, we compare our methods to single-trait methods and the ``restrictive'' multi-trait formulation using real and simulated data. In the real data analysis, higher prediction accuracies were observed from both our new broad-based multi-trait methods and the ``restrictive'' formulation. The broad-based and restrictive multi-trait methods showed similar prediction accuracies. In the simulated data analysis, higher prediction accuracies to the ``restrictive'' method were observed from our general multi-trait methods for intermediate training population size. The software tool JWAS offers open-source routines to perform these analyses.},

  abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems\textemdash patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients\textemdash and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are set to play a key role in personalised medicine. However, despite the growing application and importance of PRS, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice. We also discuss different methods for the calculation of PRS, common misconceptions regarding the interpretation of results and future challenges.},

The results visualization framework has been reworked for improved performance, compatibility and user experience. It includes a circos representation of the information contained in the alignment, an interactive covariation network, a 3D structure viewer and a sequence logo. Others components provide additional information such as residue annotations, a roc curve for assessing contact prediction, data tables and different ways of filtering the data and exporting figures. Comparison of different methods is easily done and scores combination is also possible.

  abstract = {In some species, meiotic recombination is concentrated in small genomic regions. These ``recombination hotspots'' leave signatures in fine-scale patterns of linkage disequilibrium, raising the prospect that the genomic landscape of hotspots can be characterized from sequence variation. This approach has led to the inference that hotspots evolve rapidly in some species, but are conserved in others. Historic demographic events, such as population bottlenecks, are known to affect patterns of linkage disequilibrium across the genome, violating population genetic assumptions of this approach. Although such events are prevalent, demographic history is generally ignored when making inferences about the evolution of recombination hotspots. To determine the effect of demography on the detection of recombination hotspots, we use the coalescent to simulate haplotypes with a known recombination landscape. We measure the ability of popular linkage disequilibrium-based programs to detect hotspots across a range of demographic histories, including population bottlenecks, hidden population structure, population expansions, and population contractions. We find that demographic events have the potential to greatly reduce the power and increase the false positive rate of hotspot discovery. Neither the power nor the false positive rate of hotspot detection can be predicted without also knowing the demographic history of the sample. Our results suggest that ignoring demographic history likely overestimates the power to detect hotspots and therefore underestimates the degree of hotspot sharing between species. We suggest strategies for incorporating demographic history into population genetic inferences about recombination hotspots.},

  abstract = {Relationship estimation and segment detection between individuals is an important aspect of disease gene mapping. Existing methods are either tailored for computational efficiency, or require phasing to improve accuracy. We developed TRUFFLE, a method that integrates computational techniques and statistical principles for the identification and visualization of identity-by-descent (IBD) segments using un-phased data. By skipping the haplotype phasing step and, instead, relying on a simpler region-based approach, our method is computationally efficient while maintaining inferential accuracy. In addition, an error model corrects for segment break-ups that occur as a consequence of genotyping errors. TRUFFLE can estimate relatedness for 3.1 million pairs from the 1000 Genomes Project data in a few minutes on a typical laptop computer. Consistent with expectation, we identified only three second cousin or closer pairs across different populations, while commonly used methods identified a large number of such pairs. Similarly, within populations, we identified much fewer related pairs. Compared to methods relying on phased data, TRUFFLE has comparable accuracy but is drastically faster and has fewer broken segments. We also identified specific local genomic regions that are commonly shared within populations, suggesting selection. When applied to pedigree data, we observed 99.6\% accuracy in detecting 1st to 5th degree relationships. As genomic datasets become much larger, TRUFFLE can enable disease gene mapping through implicit shared haplotypes by accurate IBD segment detection.},

The first citrus reference genome (Citrus x clementina) has been publicly available since 2011; however, previous studies in citrus have not utilized the whole genome for LTR-RT marker development. In this study, 3959 full-length LTR-RTs were identified in the C. x clementina genome using structure-based (LTR\_FINDER) and homology-based (RepeatMasker) methods. LTR-RTs were first classified by protein domain into Gypsy and Copia superfamilies, and then clustered into 1074 families based on LTR sequence similarity. Three hundred fifty Copia families were grouped into four lineages: Retrofit, Tork, Sire, and Oryco. One hundred seventy-eight Gypsy families were sorted into six lineages: Athila, Tat, Renia, CRM, Galadriel, and Del. Most LTR-RTs (3218 or 81.3\%) were anchored to the nine Clementine mandarin linkage groups, accounting for 9.74\% of chromosomes currently assembled. Accessions of 25 Rutaceae species were genotyped using 17 inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) markers developed from conserved LTR regions. Sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP) makers were used to distinguish `Valencia' and `Pineapple' sweet oranges (C. x sinensis), and 24 sweet orange clones. LTR-RT markers developed from the Clementine genome can be transferred within the Rutaceae family demonstrating that they are an excellent tool for citrus and Rutaceae genetic analysis.},

Standard population-genetic methods for inferring evolutionary history are ill-suited for polygenic traits\textemdash when there are many variants of small effect, signatures of natural selection are spread across the genome and subtle at any one locus. In the last several years, several methods have emerged for detecting the action of natural selection on polygenic scores, sums of genotypes weighted by GWAS effect sizes. However, most existing methods do not reveal the timing or strength of selection. Here, we present a set of methods for estimating the historical time course of a population-mean polygenic score using local coalescent trees at GWAS loci. These time courses are estimated by using coalescent theory to relate the branch lengths of trees to allele-frequency change. The resulting time course can be tested for evidence of natural selection. We present theory and simulations supporting our procedures, as well as estimated time courses of polygenic scores for human height. Because of its grounding in coalescent theory, the framework presented here can be extended to a variety of demographic scenarios, and its usefulness will increase as both GWAS and ancestral recombination graph (ARG) inference continue to progress.},

These spectra derive from the coalescent approach of Fu (1995) for finite samples, which is reviewed. Remarkably simple expressions are obtained for the linked SFS of a large population, which are also solutions of the multiallelic Kolmogorov equations. These formulae are the immediate extensions of the well known single site \texttheta{} /f neutral SFS. Besides the general interest in these spectra, they relate to relevant biological cases, such as structural variants and introgressions. As an application, a recipe to adapt Tajima's D and other SFS-based neutrality tests to a non-recombining region containing a neutral marker is presented.},

Here, we leverage whole genome sequencing and expression data for 17 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) to identify STRs for which repeat number is associated with expression of nearby genes (eSTRs). Our analysis reveals more than 28,000 eSTRs. We employ fine-mapping to quantify the probability that each eSTR is causal and characterize a group of the top 1,400 fine-mapped eSTRs. We identify hundreds of eSTRs linked with published GWAS signals and implicate specific eSTRs in complex traits including height and schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease, and intelligence. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that eSTRs contribute to a range of human phenotypes and will serve as a valuable resource for future studies of complex traits.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Plant genomes reduce in size following a whole genome duplication event, and one gene in a duplicate gene pair can lose function in absence of selective pressure to maintain duplicate gene copies. Maize and its sister genus,             Tripsacum             , share a genome duplication event that occurred 5 to 26 million years ago. Because few genomic resources for             Tripsacum             exist, it is unknown whether             Tripsacum             grasses and maize have maintained a similar set of genes under purifying selection. Here we present high quality             de novo             transcriptome assemblies for two species:             Tripsacum dactyloides             and             Tripsacum floridanum             . Genes with experimental protein evidence in maize were good candidates for genes under purifying selection in both genera because pseudogenes by definition do not produce protein. We tested whether 15,160 maize genes with protein evidence are resisting gene loss and whether their             Tripsacum             homologs are also resisting gene loss. Protein-encoding maize transcripts and their             Tripsacum             homologs have higher GC content, higher gene expression levels, and more conserved expression levels than putatively untranslated maize transcripts and their             Tripsacum             homologs. These results indicate that gene loss is occurring in a similar fashion in both genera after a shared ancient polyploidy event. The             Tripsacum             transcriptome assemblies provide a high quality genomic resource that can provide insight into the evolution of maize, an highly valuable crop worldwide.

Strikingly, analysis workflows for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data usually neglect the errors introduced by potential contaminations. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of the extent and impact of contaminant DNA in WGS by analyzing more than 4,000 bacterial samples from 20 different studies. We found that contaminations are pervasive and can introduce large biases in variant analysis. We showed that these biases can translate in hundreds of false positive and negative SNPs, even for samples with slight contaminations. Studies investigating complex biological traits from sequencing data can be completely biased if contaminations are neglected during the bioinformatic analysis. We used both real and simulated data to evaluate and implement reliable, contamination-aware analysis pipelines. Our results urge for the implementation of such pipelines as sequencing technologies consolidate as a precision tool in the research and clinical context.},

  abstract = {Significance             The precise location of variants in the human genome is of utmost importance. We present a unique approach, coverage-based single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification (COBASI), which uses only perfect matches between the reads of a sequence project and a reference genome to detect and accurately identify de novo SNVs. From the perfect matches, a representation of the read coverage per nucleotide along the genome, the variation landscape, is generated. SNVs are then pinpointed as significant changes in coverage and de novo SNVs can be identified with high precision. The performance of COBASI was analyzed using simulations and experimentally validated by sequencing de novo SNVs identified from a parent\textendash offspring trio. We propose this pipeline as a useful tool for different genomic applications.           ,                             The precise determination of de novo genetic variants has enormous implications across different fields of biology and medicine, particularly personalized medicine. Currently, de novo variations are identified by mapping sample reads from a parent\textendash offspring trio to a reference genome, allowing for a certain degree of differences. While widely used, this approach often introduces false-positive (FP) results due to misaligned reads and mischaracterized sequencing errors. In a previous study, we developed an alternative approach to accurately identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using only perfect matches. However, this approach could be applied only to haploid regions of the genome and was computationally intensive. In this study, we present a unique approach, coverage-based single nucleotide variant identification (COBASI), which allows the exploration of the entire genome using second-generation short sequence reads without extensive computing requirements. COBASI identifies SNVs using changes in coverage of exactly matching unique substrings, and is particularly suited for pinpointing de novo SNVs. Unlike other approaches that require population frequencies across hundreds of samples to filter out any methodological biases, COBASI can be applied to detect de novo SNVs within isolated families. We demonstrate this capability through extensive simulation studies and by studying a parent\textendash offspring trio we sequenced using short reads. Experimental validation of all 58 candidate de novo SNVs and a selection of non-de novo SNVs found in the trio confirmed zero FP calls. COBASI is available as open source at               https://github.com/Laura-Gomez/COBASI               for any researcher to use.},

  abstract = {Expression of transposable elements (TE) is transiently activated during human preimplantation embryogenesis in a developmental stage- and cell type-specific manner and TE-mediated epigenetic regulation is intrinsically wired in developmental genetic networks in human embryos and embryonic stem cells. However, there are no systematic studies devoted to a comprehensive analysis of the TE transcriptome in human adult organs and tissues, including human neural tissues. To investigate TE expression in the human Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), we developed and validated a straightforward analytical approach to chart quantitative genome-wide expression profiles of all annotated TE loci based on unambiguous mapping of discrete TE-encoded transcripts using a de novo assembly strategy. To initially evaluate the potential regulatory impact of DLPFC-expressed TE, we adopted a comparative evolutionary genomics approach across humans, primates, and rodents to document conservation patterns, lineage-specificity, and colocalizations with transcription factor binding sites mapped within primate- and human-specific TE. We identified 654,665 transcripts expressed from 477,507 distinct loci of different TE classes and families, the majority of which appear to have originated from primate-specific sequences. We discovered 4,687 human-specific and transcriptionally active TEs in DLPFC, of which the prominent majority (80.2\%) appears spliced. Our analyses revealed significant associations of DLPFC-expressed TE with primate- and human-specific transcription factor binding sites, suggesting potential cross-talks of concordant regulatory functions. We identified 1,689 TEs differentially expressed in the DLPFC of Schizophrenia patients, a majority of which is located within introns of 1,137 protein-coding genes. Our findings imply that identified DLPFC-expressed TEs may affect human brain structures and functions following different evolutionary trajectories. On one side, hundreds of thousands of TEs maintained a remarkably high conservation for \$8 My of primates' evolution, suggesting that they are likely conveying evolutionary-constrained primate-specific regulatory functions. In parallel, thousands of transcriptionally active human-specific TE loci emerged more recently, suggesting that they could be relevant for human-specific behavioral or cognitive functions.},

Currently, two draft assemblies of Nelumbo nucifera, the genomes of `China Antique' and `Chinese Tai-zi', have been released. However, there is presently no information on how the sequences are assembled into chromosomes in N. nucifera. The lack of physical maps and inadequate resolution of available genetic maps hindered the assembly of N. nucifera chromosomes. Here, a linkage map of N. nucifera containing 2371 bin markers [217 577 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] was constructed using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data of 181 F2 individuals and validated by adding 197 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Additionally, a BioNano optical map covering 86.20\% of the `Chinese Tai-zi' genome was constructed. The draft assembly of `Chinese Tai-zi' was improved based on the BioNano optical map, showing an increase of the scaffold N50 from 0.989 to 1.48 Mb. Using a combination of multiple maps, 97.9\% of the scaffolds in the `Chinese Tai-zi' draft assembly and 97.6\% of the scaffolds in the `China Antique' draft assembly were anchored into pseudo-chromosomes, and the centromere regions along the pseudo-chromosomes were identified. An evolutionary scenario was proposed to reach the modern N. nucifera karyotype from the seven ancestral eudicot chromosomes. The present study provides the highest-resolution linkage map, the optical map and chromosome level genome assemblies for N. nucifera, which are valuable for the breeding and cultivation of N. nucifera and future studies of comparative and evolutionary genomics in angiosperms.},

TRPs in human genomes may also contribute to the missing heritability of polygenic disorders.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Single-variant based genome-wide association studies have successfully detected many genetic variants that are associated with many complex traits. However, their power is limited due to weak marginal signals and ignoring potential complex interactions among genetic variants. Set-based strategy was proposed to provide a remedy where multiple genetic variants in a given set (e.g., gene or pathway) are jointly evaluated, so that the systematic effect of the set is considered. Among many, the kernel-based testing (KBT) framework is one of the most popular and powerful methods in set-based association studies. Given a set of candidate kernels, method has been proposed to choose the one with the smallest p-value. Such a method, however, can yield inflated type I error, especially when the number of variants in a set is large. Alternatively one can get p-values by permutations which, however, could be very time consuming. In this work, we proposed an efficient testing procedure that can not only control type I error rate but also generate power close to the one obtained under the optimal kernel. Our method is built upon the KBT framework and is based on asymptotic results under a high-dimensional setting. Hence it can efficiently deal with the case where the number of variants in a set is much larger than the sample size. Both simulation and real data analysis demonstrate the advantages of the method compared with its counterparts.},

  abstract = {Measuring positive selection in DNA sequences between species is key to testing the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Here, we compare the two most commonly used tests that rely on very different assumptions. The McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test1 compares divergence and polymorphism data, while the PAML test2,3 analyzes multi-species divergence. We used these two methods concurrently to detect positive selection on the same phylogenetic branch in Drosophila and Arabidopsis using large-scale genomic data. When applied to individual coding genes, both MK and PAML identify more than 100 adaptively evolving genes but the two sets hardly overlap. To rule out false negatives, we merged 20 - 30 genes into ``supergenes'', 8\% - 56\% of which yield adaptive signals. Nevertheless, the joint calls still do not overlap. The technical explanations of high false negatives or positives can be rejected. The most likely explanation is the relaxation of negative selection, which results in patterns resembling positive selection and is easily testable by using multi-species polymorphisms. When so tested, Arabidopsis (but not Drosophila) data fit this hypothesis. PAML and MK may indeed identify distinct classes of genes in Drosophila. However, this ``both are right'' explanation is valid only if positive and negative selection tend to affect the same targets, thus contradicting the (untested) conventional view. In conclusion, the acceptance of adaptive DNA evolution, and hence the rejection of the neutral theory, should be suspended until negative selection is rigorously analyzed.},

If pleiotropy arises because the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) influences one trait, which in turn influences another (`vertical pleiotropy'), then Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used to estimate the causal influence between the traits. Of prime focus among the many limitations to MR is the unprovable assumption that apparent pleiotropic associations are mediated by the exposure (i.e. reflect vertical pleiotropy), and do not arise due to SNPs influencing the two traits through independent pathways (`horizontal pleiotropy'). The burgeoning treasure trove of genetic associations yielded through genome wide association studies makes for a tantalizing prospect of phenome-wide causal inference. Recent years have seen substantial attention devoted to the problem of horizontal pleiotropy, and in this review we outline how newly developed methods can be used together to improve the reliability of MR.},

A wide variety of molecular and computational genomic approaches are available and have been used in ecological and evolutionary studies. There is no single best approach; rather, the genomic approach used should be tailored to best address the particular study goals and guided by the biology of the system. A large number of trade-offs, costs, and benefits distinguish genomic approaches, which we discuss below.

  abstract = {Background: Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that can bind to DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. Many TFs are master regulators in cells that contribute to tissue-specific and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in eukaryotes. Maize has been a model organism for over one hundred years, but little is known about its tissue-specific gene regulation through TFs. In this study, we used a network approach to elucidate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in four tissues (leaf, root, SAM and seed) in maize. We utilized GENIE3, a machine-learning algorithm combined with large quantity of RNA-Seq expression data to construct four tissue-specific GRNs. Unlike some other techniques, this approach is not limited by high-quality Position Weighed Matrix (PWM), and can therefore predict GRNs for over 2000 TFs in maize. Results: Although many TFs were expressed across multiple tissues, a multi-tiered analysis predicted tissue-specific regulatory functions for many transcription factors. Some well-studied TFs emerged within the four tissue-specific GRNs, and the GRN predictions matched expectations based upon published results for many of these examples. Our GRNs were also validated by ChIP-Seq datasets (KN1, FEA4 and O2). Key TFs were identified for each tissue and matched expectations for key regulators in each tissue, including GO enrichment and identity with known regulatory factors for that tissue. We also found functional modules in each network by clustering analysis with the MCL algorithm. Conclusions: By combining publicly available genome-wide expression data and network analysis, we can uncover GRNs at tissue-level resolution in maize. Since ChIP-Seq and PWMs are still limited in several model organisms, our study provides a uniform platform that can be adapted to any species with genome-wide expression data to construct GRNs. We also present a publicly available database, maize tissue-specific GRN (mGRN, https://www.bio.fsu.edu/mcginnislab/ mgrn/), for easy querying.

In this study, we show that there is an association between these two events, particularly in recent Brassica napus synthetic accessions, and that these represent a novel source of genetic diversity, which can be captured for the improvement of this important crop species. By assembling the pangenome of B. napus, we show that 38\% of the genes display PAV behaviour, with some of these variable genes predicted to be involved in important agronomic traits including flowering time, disease resistance, acyl lipid metabolism and glucosinolate metabolism.

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in a pan-cancer cohort including 961 tumours from children, adolescents, and young adults, comprising 24 distinct molecular types of cancer. Using a standardized workflow, we identified marked differences in terms of mutation frequency and significantly mutated genes in comparison to previously analysed adult cancers. Genetic alterations in 149 putative cancer driver genes separate the tumours into two classes: small mutation and structural/copy-number variant (correlating with germline variants). Structural variants, hyperdiploidy, and chromothripsis are linked to               TP53               mutation status and mutational signatures. Our data suggest that 7\textendash 8\% of the children in this cohort carry an unambiguous predisposing germline variant and that nearly 50\% of paediatric neoplasms harbour a potentially druggable event, which is highly relevant for the design of future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background: The increasing application of next generation sequencing technologies has led to the availability of thousands of reference genomes, often providing multiple genomes for the same or closely related species. The current approach to represent a species or a population with a single reference sequence and a set of variations cannot represent their full diversity and introduces bias towards the chosen reference. There is a need for the representation of multiple sequences in a composite way that is compatible with existing data sources for annotation and suitable for established sequence analysis methods. At the same time, this representation needs to be easily accessible and extendable to account for the constant change of available genomes. Results: We introduce seq-seq-pan, a framework that provides methods for adding or removing new genomes from a set of aligned genomes and uses these to construct a whole genome alignment. Throughout the sequential workflow the alignment is optimized for generating a representative linear presentation of the aligned set of genomes, that enables its usage for annotation and in downstream analyses. Conclusions: By providing dynamic updates and optimized processing, our approach enables the usage of whole genome alignment in the field of pan-genomics. In addition, the sequential workflow can be used as a fast alternative to existing whole genome aligners for aligning closely related genomes. seq-seq-pan is freely available at https://gitlab.com/rki\_bioinformatics},

In this study, various trends associated with synonymous codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes were investigated, and the results are reported. Identification of factors that influence codon usage in chosen monkeypox viral genomes was done using various codon usage indices, such as the relative synonymous codon usage, the effective number of codons, and the codon adaptation index. The Spearman rank correlation analysis and a correspondence analysis were used for correlating various factors with codon usage. The results revealed that mutational pressure due to compositional constraints, gene expression level, and selection at the codon level for utilization of putative optimal codons are major factors influencing synonymous codon usage bias in monkeypox viral genomes. A cluster analysis of relative synonymous codon usage values revealed a grouping of more virulent strains as one major cluster (Central African strains) and a grouping of less virulent strains (West African strains) as another major cluster, indicating a relationship between virulence and synonymous codon usage bias. This study concluded that a balance between the mutational pressure acting at the base composition level and the selection pressure acting at the amino acid level frames synonymous codon usage bias in the chosen monkeypox viruses. The natural selection from the host does not seem to have influenced the synonymous codon usage bias in the analyzed monkeypox viral genomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed relationships between over 57,000 genetic variants and diseases. However, unlike Mendelian diseases, complex diseases arise from the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Natural selection has led to a high tendency of risk alleles to be enriched in minor alleles in Mendelian diseases. Therefore, an allele that was previously advantageous or neutral may later become harmful, making it a risk allele. Methods: Using data in the NHGRI-EBI Catalog and the VARIMED database, we investigated whether (1) GWASs more easily detect risk alleles and (2) facilitate evolutionary insights by comparing risk allele frequencies of different diseases. We conducted computer simulations of P-values for association tests when major and minor alleles were risk alleles. We compared the expected proportion of SNVs whose risk alleles were minor alleles with the observed proportion. Results: Our statistical results revealed that risk alleles were enriched in minor alleles, especially for variants with low minor allele frequencies (MAFs {$<$} 0.1). Our computer simulations revealed that {$>$} 50\% risk alleles were minor alleles because of the larger difference in the power of GWASs to differentiate between minor and major alleles, especially with low MAFs or when the number of controls exceeds the number of cases. However, the observed ratios between minor and major alleles in low MAFs ({$<$} 0.1) were much larger than the expected ratios of GWAS's power imbalance, especially for diseases whose average risk allele frequencies were low, such as myopia, sudden cardiac arrest, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conclusions: Minor alleles are more likely to be risk alleles in the published GWASs on complex diseases. One reason is that minor alleles are more easily detected as risk alleles in GWASs. Even when correcting for the GWAS's power imbalance, minor alleles are more likely to be risk alleles, especially in some diseases whose average risk allele frequencies are low. These analyses serve as a starting point for future studies on quantifying the degree of negative natural selection in various complex diseases.},

Kistler               et al.               applied genomic analysis to ancient and extant South American maize lineages to investigate the genetic changes that accompanied domestication (see the Perspective by Zeder). The origin of modern maize cultivars likely involved a ``semidomesticated'' lineage that moved out of Mexico. Later improvements then occurred among multiple South American populations, including those in southwestern Amazonia.

Landrace and archaeological maize genomes from South America suggest that the ancestral population to South American maize was brought out of the domestication center in Mexico and became isolated from the wild teosinte gene pool before traits of domesticated maize were fixed. Deeply structured lineages then evolved within South America out of this partially domesticated progenitor population. Genomic, linguistic, archaeological, and paleoecological data suggest that the southwestern Amazon was a secondary improvement center for partially domesticated maize. Multiple waves of human-mediated dispersal are responsible for the diversity and biogeography of modern South American maize.},

  abstract = {Synonymous mutations do not alter the specified amino acid but may alter the structure or function of an mRNA in ways that impact fitness. There are few examples in the literature, however, in which the effects of synonymous mutations on microbial growth rates have been measured, and even fewer for which the underlying mechanism is understood. We evolved four populations of a strain of Salmonella enterica in which a promiscuous enzyme has been recruited to replace an essential enzyme. A previously identified point mutation increases the enzyme's ability to catalyze the newly needed reaction (required for arginine biosynthesis) but decreases its ability to catalyze its native reaction (required for proline biosynthesis). The poor performance of this enzyme limits growth rate on glucose. After 260 generations, we identified two synonymous mutations in the first six codons of the gene encoding the weak-link enzyme that increase growth rate by 41 and 67\%. We introduced all possible synonymous mutations into the first six codons and found substantial effects on growth rate; one doubles growth rate, and another completely abolishes growth. Computational analyses suggest that these mutations affect either the stability of a stemloop structure that sequesters the start codon or the accessibility of the region between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon. Thus, these mutations would be predicted to affect translational efficiency and thereby indirectly affect mRNA stability because translating ribosomes protect mRNA from degradation. Experimental data support these hypotheses. We conclude that the effects of the synonymous mutations are due to a combination of effects on mRNA stability and translation efficiency that alter levels of the weak-link enzyme. These findings suggest that synonymous mutations can have profound effects on fitness under strong selection and that their importance in evolution may be underappreciated.},

Building on the digenic protein-protein interaction network, Kuzmin               et al.               created a trigenic landscape of yeast by using a synthetic genetic array (see the Perspective by Walhout).

These converged on networks identified in the digenic interaction landscape. Although the overall effects were weaker for trigenic than for digenic interactions, trigenic interactions were more likely to bridge biological processes in the cell.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaao1729               ; see also p.               269                        ,              Trigenic interactions in yeast link bioprocesses are explored.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Genetic interactions occur when mutations in different genes combine to result in a phenotype that is different from expectation based on those of the individual mutations. Negative genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations leads to a fitness defect that is more exacerbated than expected. For example, synthetic lethality occurs when two mutations, neither of which is lethal on its own, generate an inviable double mutant. Alternatively, positive genetic interactions occur when genetic perturbations combine to generate a double mutant with a greater fitness than expected. Global digenic interaction studies have been useful for understanding the functional wiring diagram of the cell and may also provide insight into the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, which is important for tracking the missing heritability of human health and disease. Here we describe a network of higher-order trigenic interactions and explore its implications.                                         RATIONALE               Variation in phenotypic outcomes in different individuals is caused by genetic determinants that act as modifiers. Modifier loci are prevalent in human populations, but knowledge regarding how variants interact to modulate phenotype in different individuals is lacking. Similarly, in yeast, traits including conditional essentiality\textemdash in which certain genes are essential in one genetic background but nonessential in another\textemdash often result from an interplay of multiple modifier loci. Because complex modifiers may underlie the genetic basis of physiological states found in natural populations, it is critical to understand the landscape of higher-order genetic interactions.                                         RESULTS               To survey trigenic interactions, we designed query strains that sampled key features of the global digenic interaction network: (i) digenic interaction strength, (ii) average number of digenic interactions, and (iii) digenic interaction profile similarity. In total, we tested \textasciitilde 400,000 double and \textasciitilde 200,000 triple mutants for fitness defects and identified \textasciitilde 9500 digenic and \textasciitilde 3200 trigenic negative interactions. Although trigenic interactions tend to be weaker than digenic interactions, they were both enriched for functional relationships. About one-third of trigenic interactions identified ``novel'' connections that were not observed in our digenic control network, whereas the remaining approximately two-thirds of trigenic interactions ``modified'' a digenic interaction, suggesting that the global digenic interaction network is important for understanding the trigenic interaction network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions also bridged distant bioprocesses. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is \textasciitilde 100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance.                                         CONCLUSION               The extensive network of trigenic interactions and their ability to generate functionally diverse phenotypes suggest that higher-order genetic interactions may play a key role in the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, genome size, and speciation.                                                   Systematic analysis of trigenic interactions.                                        We surveyed                                          for trigenic interactions and found that they are \textasciitilde 100 times as prevalent as digenic interactions, often modify a digenic interaction, and connect functionally related genes as well as genes in more diverse bioprocesses (multicolored nodes). PPI, protein-protein interaction.                                                                                            ,              To systematically explore complex genetic interactions, we constructed \textasciitilde 200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction network and tested for a genetic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is \textasciitilde 100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.},

We used whole-genome resequencing data from alpine rock-cress to study how genetic variation and purifying selection vary with mating system. We find that populations with intermediate outcrossing rates have similar levels of genetic diversity as outcrossing populations, and that purifying selection against harmful alleles is efficient in mixed-mating populations. In contrast, self-fertilizing populations from Scandinavia have strongly reduced genetic diversity and accumulate harmful mutations, likely as a result of demographic effects of postglacial colonization. Our results suggest that mixed-mating populations can avoid some of the negative evolutionary consequences of high self-fertilization rates.           ,                             Plant mating systems have profound effects on levels and structuring of genetic variation and can affect the impact of natural selection. Although theory predicts that intermediate outcrossing rates may allow plants to prevent accumulation of deleterious alleles, few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. Here, we study the effect of mating system on purifying selection by conducting population-genomic analyses on whole-genome resequencing data from 38 European individuals of the arctic-alpine crucifer               Arabis alpina               . We find that outcrossing and mixed-mating populations maintain genetic diversity at similar levels, whereas highly self-fertilizing Scandinavian               A. alpina               show a strong reduction in genetic diversity, most likely as a result of a postglacial colonization bottleneck. We further find evidence for accumulation of genetic load in highly self-fertilizing populations, whereas the genome-wide impact of purifying selection does not differ greatly between mixed-mating and outcrossing populations. Our results demonstrate that intermediate levels of outcrossing may allow efficient selection against harmful alleles, whereas demographic effects can be important for relaxed purifying selection in highly selfing populations. Thus, mating system and demography shape the impact of purifying selection on genomic variation in               A. alpina               . These results are important for an improved understanding of the evolutionary consequences of mating system variation and the maintenance of mixed-mating strategies.},

In this paper, we propose novel computational approaches to address two outstanding issues in Bayesian multi-SNP genetic association analysis: namely, the control of false positive discoveries of identified association signals and the maximization of the efficiency of statistical inference by utilizing summary statistics. Quantifying the strength and uncertainty of genetic association signals has been a long-standing theme in statistical genetics. However, there is a lack of formal statistical procedures that can rigorously control type I errors in multi-SNP analysis. We propose an intuitive hierarchical representation of genetic association signals based on Bayesian posterior probabilities, which subsequently enables rigorous control of false discovery rate (FDR) and construction of Bayesian credible sets. From the perspective of statistical data reduction, we examine the computational approaches of multi-SNP analysis using             z             -statistics from single-SNP association testing and conclude that they likely yield conservative results comparing to using individual-level data. Built on this result, we propose a set of sufficient summary statistics that can lead to identical results as individual-level data without sacrificing power. Our novel computational approaches are implemented in the software package, DAP-G (             https://github.com/xqwen/dap             ), which applies to both GWASs and genome-wide molecular QTL mapping studies. It is highly computationally efficient and approximately 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art implementation of Bayesian multi-SNP analysis software. We demonstrate the proposed computational approaches using carefully constructed simulation studies and illustrate a complete workflow for multi-SNP analysis of             cis             expression quantitative trait loci using the whole blood data from the GTEx project.},

Cases of convergent adaptation inform our ideas about the ecological and molecular basis of adaptation. In judging the degree to which putative cases of convergent adaptation provide independent replication of the process of adaptation, it is necessary to establish the degree to which the evolutionary change is unexpected under null models and to show that selection has repeatedly, independently driven these changes. Here, we discuss the issues that arise from these questions particularly for closely-related populations, where gene flow and standing variation add additional layers of complexity. We outline a conceptual framework to guide intuition as to the extent to which evolutionary change represents the independent gain of information due to selection and show that this is a measure of how surprised we should be by convergence. Additionally, we summarize the ways population and quantitative genetics and genomics may help us address questions related to convergent adaptation, as well as open new questions and avenues of research.},

The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods: We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk. Results: The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions: By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

  abstract = {The bovine genetic resources in China are diverse, but their value and potential are yet to be discovered. To determine the genetic diversity and population structure of Chinese cattle, we analyzed the whole genomes of 46 cattle from six phenotypically and geographically representative Chinese cattle breeds, together with 18 Red Angus cattle genomes, 11 Japanese black cattle genomes and taurine and indicine genomes available from previous studies. Our results showed that Chinese cattle originated from hybridization between Bos taurus and Bos indicus. Moreover, we found that the level of genetic variation in Chinese cattle depends upon the degree of indicine content. We also discovered many potential selective sweep regions associated with domestication related to breed-specific characteristics, with selective sweep regions including genes associated with coat color (ERCC2, MC1R, ZBTB17, and MAP2K1), dairy traits (NCAPG, MAPK7, FST, ITFG1, SETMAR, PAG1, CSN3, and RPL37A), and meat production/quality traits (such as BBS2, R3HDM1, IGFBP2, IGFBP5, MYH9, MYH4, and MC5R). These findings substantially expand the catalogue of genetic variants in cattle and reveal new insights into the evolutionary history and domestication traits of Chinese cattle.},

In this study, we tested whether identifying QTLs in the framework of GWAS can be based only on linkage information. Our study sought to validate a method to replace LD with linkage in association studies, and we investigated the statistical power of different heritabilities and the number of QTLs using simulation data. We found that it is entirely feasible to exploit the multiple regression method for GWASs using only linkage information. Similar to the typical genomewide association tests using LD information, our new approach performed validly when the multiple regression based on linkage method was employed. However, the performance improved slightly when the linkage was used alone, which was much closer to the traditional GWAS model using single marker regression. Meanwhile, the statistical power of the new method decreased with increasing number of QTLs, and its power was sensitive to heritability. In summary, these results suggest that this method can identify QTLs, although the power is relatively weak. The cause of this phenomenon remains unknown.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila genus is a unique group containing a wide range of species that occupy diverse ecosystems. In addition to the most widely studied species, Drosophila melanogaster, many other members in this genus also possess a well-developed set of genetic tools. Indeed, high-quality genomes exist for several species within the genus, facilitating studies of the function and evolution of cis-regulatory regions and proteins by allowing comparisons across at least 50 million years of evolution. Yet, the available genomes still fail to capture much of the substantial genetic diversity within the Drosophila genus. We have therefore tested protocols to rapidly and inexpensively sequence and assemble the genome from any Drosophila species using single-molecule sequencing technology from Oxford Nanopore. Here, we use this technology to present highly contiguous genome assemblies of 15 Drosophila species: 10 of the 12 originally sequenced Drosophila species (ananassae, erecta, mojavensis, persimilis, pseudoobscura, sechellia, simulans, virilis, willistoni, and yakuba), four additional species that had previously reported assemblies (biarmipes, bipectinata, eugracilis, and mauritiana), and one novel assembly (triauraria). Genomes were generated from an average of 29x depth-of-coverage data that after assembly resulted in an average contig N50 of 4.4 Mb. Subsequent alignment of contigs from the published reference genomes demonstrates that our assemblies could be used to close over 60\% of the gaps present in the currently published reference genomes. Importantly, the materials and reagents cost for each genome was approximately \$1,000 (USD). This study demonstrates the power and cost-effectiveness of long-read sequencing for genome assembly in Drosophila and provides a framework for the affordable sequencing and assembly of additional Drosophila genomes.},

Unlike previously studied effects of synonymous mutations, the effect that we discovered is independent of translation, but it depends on the production of toxic mRNA molecules. We hypothesize that the mechanism we identified influences the evolution of endogenous genes in bacteria by imposing selective constraints on synonymous mutations that arise in the genome. Of interest for biotechnology and synthetic biology, we identify bacterial strains and growth conditions that alleviate RNA toxicity, thus allowing efficient overexpression of heterologous proteins.                        ,                             Many organisms are subject to selective pressure that gives rise to unequal usage of synonymous codons, known as codon bias. To experimentally dissect the mechanisms of selection on synonymous sites, we expressed several hundred synonymous variants of the GFP gene in               Escherichia coli               , and used quantitative growth and viability assays to estimate bacterial fitness.

Unlike previously studied effects of synonymous mutations, the effect that we discovered is independent of translation, but it depends on the production of toxic mRNA molecules. We identified RNA sequence determinants of toxicity and evolved suppressor strains that can tolerate the expression of toxic GFP variants. Genome sequencing of these suppressor strains revealed a cluster of promoter mutations that prevented toxicity by reducing mRNA levels. We conclude that translation-independent RNA toxicity is a previously unrecognized obstacle in bacterial gene expression.},

The sparseness of early land plant megafossils and stratigraphic controls on their distribution make the fossil record an unreliable guide, leaving only the molecular clock. However, the application of molecular clock methodology is challenged by the current impasse in attempts to resolve the evolutionary relationships among the living bryophytes and tracheophytes. Here, we establish a timescale for early land plant evolution that integrates over topological uncertainty by exploring the impact of competing hypotheses on bryophyte-tracheophyte relationships, among other variables, on divergence time estimation. We codify 37 fossil calibrations for Viridiplantae following best practice. We apply these calibrations in a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis of a phylogenomic dataset encompassing the diversity of Embryophyta and their relatives within Viridiplantae. Topology and dataset sizes have little impact on age estimates, with greater differences among alternative clock models and calibration strategies. For all analyses, a Cambrian origin of Embryophyta is recovered with highest probability. The estimated ages for crown tracheophytes range from Late Ordovician to late Silurian.

To fully characterize their roles in deriving the complex traits/diseases, it is necessary to annotate all CREs and CRMs encoded in the human genome. However, the current annotations of CREs and CRMs in the human genome are still very limited and mostly coarse-grained, as they often lack the detailed information of CREs in CRMs. Here, we integrated 620 TF ChIP-seq datasets produced by the ENCODE project for 168 TFs in 79 different cell/tissue types and predicted an unprecedentedly completely map of CREs in CRMs in the human genome at single nucleotide resolution. The map includes 305 912 CRMs containing a total of 1 178 913 CREs belonging to 736 unique TF binding motifs. The predicted CREs and CRMs tend to be subject to either purifying selection or positive selection, thus are likely to be functional.

Commonly used LD indices such as r2 handle LD of biallelic variants for two sites. As shown in a previously introduced LD index of {$\epsilon$}, normalized entropy difference of the haplotype frequency between LD and linkage equilibrium (LE) could be utilized to estimate LD of biallelic variants for multiple sites. Here, we developed eLD (entropy-based Linkage Disequilibrium index between multiallelic sites) as publicly available software to calculate {$\epsilon$} of multiallelic variants for two sites. Application of eLD could dissect complex LD structures among multiple HLA genes (e.g., strong LD among HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 in East Asians). Use of eLD is not restricted to haplotype-based LD; it is also applicable to genotype-based LD. Therefore, eLD enables estimation of trans-regional LD of SNP genotypes at two unlinked loci, such as the nonlinear LD between functional missense variants of ADH1B (rs1229984 [Arg47His]) and ALDH2 (rs671 [Glu504Lys]).},

The replicated sequence contains several classes of mobile genetic elements including helitrons, raising the intriguing possibility of extra-chromosomal replication of the EPSPS-containing sequence. In kochia (Kochia scoparia), from 3 to more than 10 extra EPSPS copies are arranged as a tandem gene duplication at one locus. In the remaining 6 weed species that exhibit EPSPS gene duplication, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of gene duplication or their entire sequence. There is mounting evidence that adaptive gene amplification is an important mode of evolution in the face of intense human-mediated selection pressure. The convergent evolution of CNVs for glyphosate resistance in weeds, through at least 2 different mechanisms, may be indicative of a more general importance for this mechanism of adaptation in plants. CNVs warrant further investigation across plant functional genomics for adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses, particularly for adaptive evolution on rapid time scales.},

  abstract = {The concept of haplotype blocks has been shown to be useful in genetics. Fields of application range from the detection of regions under positive selection to statistical methods that make use of dimension reduction. We propose a novel approach (``HaploBlocker'') for defining and inferring haplotype blocks that focuses on linkage instead of the commonly used population-wide measures of linkage disequilibrium. We define a haplotype block as a sequence of genetic markers that has a predefined minimum frequency in the population and only haplotypes with a similar sequence of markers are considered to carry that block, effectively screening a dataset for group-wise identity-by-descent. From these haplotype blocks we construct a haplotype library that represents a large proportion of genetic variability with a limited number of blocks. Our method is implemented in the associated R-package HaploBlocker and provides flexibility to not only optimize the structure of the obtained haplotype library for subsequent analyses, but is also able to handle datasets of different marker density and genetic diversity. By using haplotype blocks instead of SNPs, local epistatic interactions can be naturally modelled and the reduced number of parameters enables a wide variety of new methods for further genomic analyses such as genomic prediction and the detection of selection signatures. We illustrate our methodology with a dataset comprising 501 doubled haploid lines in a European maize landrace genotyped at 501'124 SNPs. With the suggested approach, we identified 2'991 haplotype blocks with an average length of 2'685 SNPs that together represent 94\% of the dataset.},

STR expansions (large copy number increases) are found in most strains, several of which have evident functional effects. These include three of six intronic STR expansions we found to be associated with intron retention. Coding STRs were depleted of variation relative to noncoding STRs, and we detected a total of 56 coding STRs (11\%) showing low variation consistent with the action of purifying selection. In contrast, some STRs show hypervariable patterns consistent with diversifying selection. Finally, we detected 133 novel STR-phenotype associations under stringent criteria, most of which could not be detected with SNPs alone, and validated some with follow-up experiments. Our results support the conclusion that STRs constitute a large, unascertained reservoir of functionally relevant genomic variation.},

Field-based quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies provide direct but low-resolution evidence for the genetic basis of local adaptation. Using high-resolution population genomic approaches, we examine local adaptation along previously identified genetic trade-off (GT) and conditionally neutral (CN) QTLs for fitness between locally adapted Italian and Swedish               A. thaliana               populations [\AA gren J, et al.

  abstract = {Abstract           Chardonnay is the basis of some of the world's most iconic wines and its success is underpinned by a historic program of clonal selection. There are numerous clones of Chardonnay available that exhibit differences in key viticultural and oenological traits that have arisen from the accumulation of somatic mutations during centuries of asexual propagation. However, the genetic variation that underlies these differences remains largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, a high-quality, diploid-phased Chardonnay genome assembly was produced from single-molecule real time sequencing, and combined with re-sequencing data from 15 different commercial Chardonnay clones. There were 1620 markers identified that distinguish the 15 Chardonnay clones. These markers were reliably used for clonal identification of validation genomic material, as well as in identifying a potential genetic basis for some clonal phenotypic differences. The predicted parentage of the Chardonnay haplomes was elucidated by mapping sequence data from the predicted parents of Chardonnay (Gouais blanc and Pinot noir) against the Chardonnay reference genome. This enabled the detection of instances of heterosis, with differentially-expanded gene families being inherited from the parents of Chardonnay. Most surprisingly however, the patterns of nucleotide variation present in the Chardonnay genome indicate that Pinot noir and Gouais blanc share an extremely high degree of kinship that has resulted in the Chardonnay genome displaying characteristics that are indicative of inbreeding.                        Author Summary             Phenotypic variation within a grapevine cultivar arises from an accumulation of mutations from serial vegetative propagation. Old cultivars such as Chardonnay have been propagated for centuries resulting in hundreds of available `clones' containing unique genetic mutations and a range of various phenotypic peculiarities. The genetic mutations can be leveraged as genetic markers and are useful in identifying specific clones for authenticity testing, or as breeding markers for new clonal selections where particular mutations are known to confer a phenotypic trait. We produced a high-quality genome assembly for Chardonnay, and using re-sequencing data for 15 popular clones, were able to identify a large selection of markers that are unique to at least one clone. We identified mutations that may confer phenotypic effects, and were able to identify clones from material independently sourced from nurseries and vineyards. The marker detection framework we describe for authenticity testing would be applicable to other grapevine cultivars or even other agriculturally important woody-plant crops that are vegetatively propagated such as fruit orchards. Finally, we show that the Chardonnay genome contains extensive evidence for parental inbreeding, such that its parents, Gouais blanc and Pinot noir, may even represent first-degree relatives.},

  abstract = {Populations of broadcast spawning marine organisms often have large sizes and are exposed to reduced genetic drift. Under such scenarios, strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across \textasciitilde 800 km. Genotype\textendash environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global FST = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a steppingstone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal environmental heterogeneity in a connected metapopulation of a broadcast spawner.},

  abstract = {What proportion of coding sequence nucleotides have roles in splicing, and how strong is the selection that maintains them? Despite a large body of research into exonic splice regulatory signals, these questions have not been answered. This is because, to our knowledge, previous investigations have not explicitly disentangled the frequency of splice regulatory elements from the strength of the evolutionary constraint under which they evolve. Current data are consistent both with a scenario of weak and diffuse constraint, enveloping large swaths of sequence, as well as with well-defined pockets of strong purifying selection. In the former case, natural selection on exonic splice enhancers (ESEs) might primarily act as a slight modifier of codon usage bias. In the latter, mutations that disrupt ESEs are likely to have large fitness and, potentially, clinical effects. To distinguish between these scenarios, we used several different methods to determine the distribution of selection coefficients for new mutations within ESEs. The analyses converged to suggest that {$\sim$}15\%\textendash 20\% of fourfold degenerate sites are part of functional ESEs. Most of these sites are under strong evolutionary constraint. Therefore, exonic splice regulation does not simply impose a weak bias that gently nudges coding sequence evolution in a particular direction. Rather, the selection to preserve these motifs is a strong force that severely constrains the evolution of a substantial proportion of coding nucleotides. Thus synonymous mutations that disrupt ESEs should be considered as a potentially common cause of single-locus genetic disorders.},

  abstract = {Understanding the phenotypic and molecular mechanisms that contribute to genetic diversity between and within species is fundamental in studying the evolution of species. In particular, identifying the interspecific differences that lead to the reduction or even cessation of gene flow between nascent species is one of the main goals of speciation genetic research. Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences with the ability to move within genomes. TEs are ubiquitous throughout eukaryotic genomes and have been shown to alter regulatory networks, gene expression, and to rearrange genomes as a result of their transposition. However, no systematic effort has evaluated the role of TEs in speciation. We compiled the evidence for TEs as potential causes of reproductive isolation across a diversity of taxa. We find that TEs are often associated with hybrid defects that might preclude the fusion between species, but that the involvement of TEs in other barriers to gene flow different from postzygotic isolation is still relatively unknown. Finally, we list a series of guides and research avenues to disentangle the effects of TEs on the origin of new species.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Much of the worldwide dissemination of antibiotic resistance has been driven by resistance gene associations with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and transposons. Although increasing, our understanding of resistance spread remains relatively limited, as methods for tracking mobile resistance genes through multiple species, strains and plasmids are lacking. We have developed a bioinformatic pipeline for tracking variation within, and mobility of, specific transposable elements (TEs), such as transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes. TETyper takes short-read whole-genome sequencing data as input and identifies single-nucleotide mutations and deletions within the TE of interest, to enable tracking of specific sequence variants, as well as the surrounding genetic context(s), to enable identification of transposition events. To investigate global dissemination of             Klebsiella pneumoniae             carbapenemase (KPC) and its associated transposon Tn             4401             , we applied TETyper to a collection of {$>$}3000 publicly available Illumina datasets containing             bla             KPC             . This revealed surprising diversity, with {$>$}200 distinct flanking genetic contexts for Tn             4401             , indicating high levels of transposition. Integration of sample metadata revealed insights into associations between geographic locations, host species, Tn             4401             sequence variants and flanking genetic contexts. To demonstrate the ability of TETyper to cope with high copy number TEs and to track specific short-term evolutionary changes, we also applied it to the insertion sequence IS             26             within a defined             K. pneumoniae             outbreak.

SVs can alter the copy number of regulatory elements or modify the 3D genome by disrupting higher-order chromatin organization such as topologically associating domains. As a result of these position effects, SVs can influence the expression of genes distant from the SV breakpoints, thereby causing disease. The impact of SVs on the 3D genome and on gene expression regulation has to be considered when interpreting the pathogenic potential of these variant types.},

Using an entropic measure of splicing complexity, Whippet reveals that one-third of human protein coding genes produce transcripts with complex AS events involving co-expression of two or more principal splice isoforms. We observe that high-entropy AS events are more prevalent in tumor relative to matched normal tissues and correlate with increased expression of proto-oncogenic splicing factors. Whippet thus affords the rapid and accurate analysis of AS events of any complexity, and as such will facilitate future biomedical research.},

Perhaps the most detailed understanding of this process comes from             Zea mays             , where morphological, genetic, and genomic studies have elucidated the ancestry and selection that transformed a wild plant, the teosinte             Zea mays             subsp.             parviglumis             , into the domesticated maize             Zea mays             subsp.             mays             . These studies have identified five major morphological differences that distinguish these two subspecies, and careful genetic dissection of these phenotypes has assisted in understanding the underlying molecular genetic changes. But maize domestication was a consequence of more than just five genes, and regions throughout the genome contribute to this change. Their effects are contingent on genetic background, and the interactions between alleles and genes that give rise to phenotypes. This includes dominance relationships, epistatic interactions, and pleiotropic constraint, as well as how these variants are connected in gene networks. Together, we review the role of gene interactions in generating the dramatic phenotypic evolution seen in the transition from teosinte to maize.},

A fundamental unresolved question is why some STRs are susceptible to pathologic expansion, whereas thousands of repeat tracts across the human genome are relatively stable. Here, we discover that nearly all disease-associated STRs (daSTRs) are located at boundaries demarcating 3D chromatin domains. We identify a subset of boundaries with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy and the degree of FMR1 silencing. Our data uncover higherorder chromatin architecture as a new dimension in understanding repeat expansion disorders.},

Seep monkeyflower (               Mimulus guttatus               ) populations are constrained by local moisture availability and the onset of summer drought. This results in a selective tradeoff between the amount of seed set, which is determined by plant size, and the timing of reproduction. Troth               et al.               sequenced and phenotyped 187               M. guttatus               plants and identified genetic variants associated with plant and flower size and rapid flowering. In wild populations surveyed over 3 years, the magnitude of selection changed depending on the rainfall patterns. Thus, fluctuating selection may maintain genetic variation in this species.

Alleles that delayed flowering also increased size at reproduction, which suggests pervasive antagonistic pleiotropy in this annual plant. The ``large and slow'' alleles, which were less common in small, rapidly flowering populations, became more abundant in populations with greater plant size. Furthermore, natural selection within the field population favored alternative alleles from year to year. Our results suggest that environmental fluctuations and selective trade-offs maintain polygenic trait variation within populations and also contribute to the geographic divergence in this wildflower species.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Transposable elements (TEs) make up a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes, and thus are important drivers of genome evolution. However, the evolutionary forces controlling TE copy number and the extent to which TEs affect phenotypic variation on a genome-wide scale are still unclear. We characterised TE insertion polymorphism and its effects on gene expression in 124 whole genome sequences from a single population of             Capsella grandiflora             . The frequency of insertions was negatively correlated with distance to genes, as well as density of conserved non-coding elements, suggesting that the negative effects of TEs on gene regulation are important in limiting their abundance. Rare TE variants strongly influence gene expression variation, predominantly through downregulation. In contrast, rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute equally to up- and down-regulation, but have a weaker effect. Taken together, these results imply that TEs are a significant contributor to gene expression variation and can be more likely than rare SNPs to cause extreme changes in gene expression.                                   Author Summary                            Transposable elements (TEs), mobile DNA elements with the ability to excise from the genome and reinsert in new locations, are important components of genomic diversity. Due to their abundance and mobility, TEs play an influential role in genomic evolution, often deleterious. Here we show that TEs in a population of the plant               Capsella grandiflora               are most deleterious when they insert in genic and regulatory regions. We find that TEs indeed are associated with unusual levels of gene expression, predominantly decreased expression.                          Furthermore, this effect is stronger than the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with gene expression variation, highlighting the importance of TE contribution to the maintenance of expression variation.},

Identification and genotyping of genetic variants is typically carried out on short-read data aligned to a single reference, disregarding the underlying variation. Results: We propose a new unified framework for variant calling with short-read data utilizing a representation of human genetic variation \textendash{} a pan-genomic reference. We provide a modular pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing sequencing data analysis workflows. Our tool is open source and available online: https://gitlab.com/dvalenzu/PanVC. Conclusions: Our experiments show that by replacing a standard human reference with a pan-genomic one we achieve an improvement in single-nucleotide variant calling accuracy and in short indel calling accuracy over the widely adopted Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) in difficult genomic regions.},

  abstract = {Only a small fraction of patients respond to the drug prescribed to treat their disease, which means that most are at risk of unnecessary exposure to side effects through ineffective drugs. This inter-individual variation in drug response is driven by differences in gene interactions caused by each patient's genetic background, environmental exposures, and the proportions of specific cell types involved in disease. These gene interactions can now be captured by building gene regulatory networks, by taking advantage of RNA velocity (the time derivative of the gene expression state), the ability to study hundreds of thousands of cells simultaneously, and the falling price of single-cell sequencing. Here, we propose an integrative approach that leverages these recent advances in single-cell data with the sensitivity of bulk data to enable the reconstruction of personalized, cell-type- and context-specific gene regulatory networks. We expect this approach will allow the prioritization of key driver genes for specific diseases and will provide knowledge that opens new avenues towards improved personalized healthcare.},

Sequence assembly offers a powerful approach to identifying SVs, but is difficult to apply at scale genome-wide for SV detection due to its computational complexity and the difficulty of extracting SVs from assembly contigs. We describe SvABA, an efficient and accurate method for detecting SVs from short-read sequencing data using genome-wide local assembly with low memory and computing requirements. We evaluated SvABA's performance on the NA12878 human genome and in simulated and real cancer genomes. SvABA demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity across a large spectrum of SVs and substantially improves detection performance for variants in the 20\textendash 300 bp range, compared with existing methods. SvABA also identifies complex somatic rearrangements with chains of short ({$<$}1000 bp) templated-sequence insertions copied from distant genomic regions. We applied SvABA to 344 cancer genomes from 11 cancer types and found that short templated-sequence insertions occur in {$\sim$}4\% of all somatic rearrangements. Finally, we demonstrate that SvABA can identify sites of viral integration and cancer driver alterations containing medium-sized (50\textendash 300 bp) SVs.},

To better understand these two organisms at the molecular level, we compared expression profiles of both protein-coding and noncoding transcripts in 11 matched tissues using single-molecule, long-read, deep RNA sequencing. This comparative analysis revealed large numbers of novel isoforms in both species. Evolutionarily young genes were likely to be generated in reproductive tissues and usually had fewer isoforms than old genes. We also observed similarities and differences in alternative splicing patterns and activities, both among tissues and between species. The maize subgenomes exhibited no bias in isoform generation; however, genes in the B genome were more highly expressed in pollen tissue, whereas genes in the A genome were more highly expressed in endosperm. We also identified a number of splicing events conserved between maize and sorghum. In addition, we generated comprehensive and high-resolution maps of poly(A) sites, revealing similarities and differences in mRNA cleavage between the two species. Overall, our results reveal considerable splicing and expression diversity between sorghum and maize, well beyond what was reported in previous studies, likely reflecting the differences in architecture between these two species.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION               Strong genetic associations have been found for a number of psychiatric disorders. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging.                                         RATIONALE               To address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain.                                         RESULTS               The base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from \textasciitilde 32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals.               From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and \textasciitilde 2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising \textasciitilde 238,000 linkage-disequilibrium\textendash independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that {$>$}88\% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues.               The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a \textasciitilde 6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a \textasciitilde 3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses.                                         CONCLUSION               Our resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Our deep-learning model improves disease risk prediction over traditional approaches and can be extended with additional data types (e.g., microRNA and neuroimaging).                                                   A comprehensive functional genomic resource for the adult human brain.                   The resource forms a three-layer pyramid. The bottom layer includes sequencing datasets for traits, such as schizophrenia. The middle layer represents derived datasets, including functional genomic elements and QTLs. The top layer contains integrated models, which link genotypes to phenotypes. DSPN, Deep Structured Phenotype Network; PC1 and PC2, principal components 1 and 2; ref, reference; alt, alternate; H3K27ac, histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27.                                                                         ,              Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with {$>$}88\% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by \textasciitilde 6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on             quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected             . The approach is based on a new model \textemdash{} the ``Sum of Single Effects'' (             SuSiE             ) model \textemdash{} which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of ``single-effect'' vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure \textemdash{} Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) \textemdash{} which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a             distribution             on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under the             SuSiE             model. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a Credible Set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outper-form existing methods for this task, and illustrate their application to fine-mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable selection problems.},

We compared chromatin contacts in 22 cell types to LD across billions of pairs of loci in the human genome and found no concordance, even at genomic distances below 25 kilobases where both tend to be high. Gene expression and ontology data suggest that chromatin contacts identify regulatory variants more reliably than do LD and genomic proximity. We conclude that the genomic architectures of genetic and physical interactions are independent, with important implications for gene regulatory evolution and precision medicine.},

  abstract = {Codon usage bias affects the genomes of organisms from all kingdoms of life and results from both background substitution biases and natural selection. Natural selection on codon usage to increase translation accuracy and efficiency has long been known to affect gene sequences. Such selection is stronger on highly, compared with lowly expressed genes, resulting in higher levels of codon bias within genes with higher expression levels. Additionally, selection on translation accuracy affects more strongly codons encoding conserved amino acids, since these will more often affect protein folding and/or function. By applying tests of selection on the gene sequences of the bacterium Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that both highly and lowly expressed genes display signals of selection on codon usage. Such signals are found for both conserved and less conserved amino acid positions, even within the 10\% of E. coli genes expressed at the lowest levels. We further demonstrate experimentally that single synonymous codon replacements within a lowly expressed, essential gene can carry substantial effects on bacterial fitness. Combined, our results demonstrate that even within genes expressed at relatively low levels there is substantial selection on codon usage and that single synonymous codon replacements within such genes can have a marked effect on bacterial fitness.},

Recent work has highlighted the widespread functional significance of such repeats, particularly around gene regulation, but the mutational processes underlying the evolution of these highly abundant and highly variable sequences are not fully understood. Traditional models assume that strand misalignment during replication is the predominant mechanism, but empirical data suggest the involvement of other processes including recombination and transcription. Despite this evidence, the relative influences of these processes have not previously been tested experimentally on a genomewide scale. Using deep sequencing, we identify mutations at {$>$}200 microsatellites, across 700 generations in replicated populations of two otherwise identical sexual and asexual Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Using generalized linear models, we investigate correlates of STR mutability including the nature of the mutation, STR composition and contextual factors including recombination, transcription and replication origins. Sexual capability was not a significant predictor of microsatellite mutability, but, intriguingly, we identify transcription as a significant positive predictor. We also find that STR density is substantially increased in regions neighboring, but not within, recombination hotspots.},

These are difficult organisms to investigate genetically because of their AT-rich genomes. Zhang               et al.               have exploited this peculiarity by using               piggyBac               transposon insertion sites to achieve saturation-level mutagenesis for identifying and ranking essential genes and drug targets (see the Perspective by White and Rathod). Genes that are current candidates for drug targets were identified as essential, in contrast to many vaccine target genes. Notably, the proteasome degradation pathway was confirmed as a target for developing therapeutic interventions because of the several essential genes involved and the link to the mechanism of action of the current frontline drug, artemisinin.

The extreme AT-bias of the                 P. falciparum                 genome has hampered genetic studies through targeted approaches such as homologous recombination or CRISPR-Cas9, and only a few hundred                 P. falciparum                 mutants have been experimentally generated in the past decades. In this study, we have used high-throughput                 piggyBac                 transposon insertional mutagenesis and quantitative insertion site sequencing (QIseq) to reach saturation-level mutagenesis of this parasite.                                                        RATIONALE                                Our study exploits the AT-richness of the                 P. falciparum                 genome, which provides numerous                 piggyBac                 transposon insertion targets within both gene coding and noncoding flanking sequences, to generate more than 38,000                 P. falciparum                 mutants. At this level of mutagenesis, we could distinguish essential genes as nonmutable and dispensable genes as mutable. Subsequently, we identified 2680 genes essential for in vitro asexual blood-stage growth.                                                        RESULTS                                We calculated mutagenesis index scores (MISs) and mutagenesis fitness scores (MFSs) in order to functionally define the relative fitness cost of disruption for 5399 genes. A competitive growth phenotype screen confirmed that MIS and MFS were predictive of the fitness cost for in vitro asexual growth. Genes predicted to be essential included genes implicated in drug resistance\textemdash such as the ``                 K13                 '' Kelch propeller,                 mdr                 , and                 dhfr-ts                 \textemdash as well as targets considered to be high value for drugs development, such as                 pkg                 and                 cdpk5                 . The screen revealed essential genes that are specific to human                 Plasmodium                 parasites but absent from rodent-infective species, such as lipid metabolic genes that may be crucial to transmission commitment in human infections. MIS and MFS profiling provides a clear ranking of the relative essentiality of gene ontology (GO) functions in                 P. falciparum                 . GO pathways associated with translation, RNA metabolism, and cell cycle control are more essential, whereas genes associated with protein phosphorylation, virulence factors, and transcription are more likely to be dispensable. Last, we confirm that the proteasome-degradation pathway is a high-value druggable target on the basis of its high ratio of essential to dispensable genes, and by functionally confirming its link to the mode of action of artemisinin, the current front-line antimalarial.                                                        CONCLUSION                                Saturation-scale mutagenesis allows prioritization of intervention targets in the genome of the most important cause of malaria. The identification of more than 2680 essential genes, including \textasciitilde 1000                 Plasmodium                 -conserved essential genes, will be valuable for antimalarial therapeutic research.                                                                                       Saturation-scale mutagenesis of                     P. falciparum                     reveals genes essential and dispensable for asexual blood-stage development.

(Left) The MIS rates the potential mutability of                     P. falciparum                     genes based on the number of recovered CDS insertions relative to the potential number that could be recovered through large-scale mutagenesis. (Right) The MFS rates the relative fitness of                     P. falciparum                     genes based on QIseq scores of transposon insertion sites in each gene.                                                                                            ,                             Severe malaria is caused by the apicomplexan parasite               Plasmodium falciparum.               Despite decades of research, the distinct biology of these parasites has made it challenging to establish high-throughput genetic approaches to identify and prioritize therapeutic targets. Using transposon mutagenesis of               P. falciparum               in an approach that exploited its AT-rich genome, we generated more than 38,000 mutants, saturating the genome and defining mutability and fitness costs for over 87\% of genes. Of 5399 genes, our study defined 2680 genes as essential for optimal growth of asexual blood stages in vitro. These essential genes are associated with drug resistance, represent leading vaccine candidates, and include approximately 1000               Plasmodium               -conserved genes of unknown function. We validated this approach by testing proteasome pathways for individual mutants associated with artemisinin sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Abiotic stresses, especially drought and salt, severely affect maize production, which is one of the most important cereal crops in the world. Breeding stress-tolerant maize through biotechnology is urgently needed to maintain maize production. Therefore, it is important to identify new genes that can enhance both drought and salt stress tolerance for molecular breeding. In this study, we identified a maize ABA (abscisic acid)-responsive element (ABRE) binding protein from a 17day post-pollination (dpp) maize embryo cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screen using the ABRE2 sequence of the maize Cat1 gene as bait. This protein, designated, ABRE binding protein 2 (ABP2), belongs to the bZIP transcription factor family. Endogenous expression of ABP2 in maize can be detected in different tissues at various development stages, and can be induced by drought, salt, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating agents, and ABA treatment. Constitutive expression of ABP2 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress, and increased sensitivity to ABA. In exploring the mechanism by which ABP2 can stimulate abiotic stress tolerance, we found that ROS levels were reduced and expression of stress-responsive and carbon metabolism-related genes was enhanced by constitutive ABP2 expression in transgenic plants. In short, we identified a maize bZIP transcription factor which can enhance both drought and salt tolerance of plants.},

However, little is known about the population evolution of this species, the genomic difference between its major genetic clusters, such as European and Asian rapeseed, and impacts of historical large-sale introgression events in this young tetraploid. In this study, we reported the de novo assembly of the genome sequences of an Asian rapeseed (B. napus), Ningyou 7 and its four progenitors and carried out de novo assembly-based comparison, pedigree and population analysis with other available genomic data from diverse European and Asian cultivars. Our results showed that Asian rapeseed originally derived from European rapeseed, but it had subsequently significantly diverged, with rapid genome differentiation after intensive local breeding selection. The first historical introgression of B. rapa dramatically broadened the allelic pool of Asian B. napus, but decreased their deleterious variations. The secondary historical introgression of European rapeseed (canola-quality) has reshaped Asian rapeseed into two groups, accompanied by an increase in genetic load. This study demonstrates distinctive genomic footprints by recent intra- and inter-species introgression events for local adaptation, and provide novel insights for understanding the rapid genome evolution of a young allopolyploid crop.},

Here we describe ReLERNN, a deep learning method for estimating a genome-wide recombination map that is accurate even with small numbers of pooled or individually sequenced genomes. Rather than use summaries of linkage disequilibrium as its input, ReLERNN takes columns from a genotype alignment, which are then modeled as a sequence across the genome using a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that ReLERNN improves accuracy and reduces bias relative to existing methods and maintains high accuracy in the face of demographic model misspecification, missing genotype calls, and genome inaccessibility. We apply ReLERNN to natural populations of African             Drosophila melanogaster             and show that genome-wide recombination landscapes, while largely correlated among populations, exhibit important population-specific differences. Lastly, we connect the inferred patterns of recombination with the frequencies of major inversions segregating in natural             Drosophila             populations.},

Due to their repetitive nature, genomic studies of TEs are complicated by the difficulty of properly attributing multi-mapped short reads to specific genomic loci. Here, we utilize a method to attribute RNA-seq reads to TE families rather than particular loci in order to characterize transcript abundance for TE families in the maize genome. We applied this method to assess per-family expression of transposable elements in {$>$}800 published RNA-seq libraries representing a range of maize development, genotypes, and hybrids. While a relatively small proportion of TE families are transcribed, expression is highly dynamic with most families exhibiting tissue-specific expression. A large number of TE families were specifically detected in pollen and endosperm, consistent with reproductive dynamics that maintain silencing of TEs in the germ line. We find that B73 transcript abundance is a poor predictor of TE expression in other genotypes and that transcript levels can differ even for shared TEs. Finally, by assessing recombinant inbred line and hybrid transcriptomes, complex patterns of TE transcript abundance across genotypes emerged. Taken together, this study reveals a dynamic contribution of TEs to maize transcriptomes.},

We developed an approach to define shared and variable TE insertions across genome assemblies and applied this method to four maize genomes (B73, W22, Mo17 and PH207) with uniform structural annotations of TEs. Among these genomes we identified approximately 400 000 TEs that are polymorphic, encompassing 1.6 Gb of variable TE sequence. These polymorphic TEs include a combination of recent transposition events as well as deletions of older TEs. There are examples of polymorphic TEs within each of the superfamilies of TEs and they are found distributed across the genome, including in regions of recent shared ancestry among individuals. There are many examples of polymorphic TEs within or near maize genes. In addition, there are 2380 gene annotations in the B73 genome that are located within variable TEs, providing evidence for the role of TEs in contributing to the substantial differences in annotated gene content among these genotypes. TEs are highly variable in our survey of four temperate maize genomes, highlighting the major contribution of TEs in driving variation in genome organization and gene content.},

We sequence resolved 99,604 insertions, deletions, and inversions including 2,238 (1.6 Mbp) that are shared among all discovery genomes with an additional 13,053 (6.9 Mbp) present in the majority, indicating minor alleles or errors in the reference. Genotyping in 440 additional genomes confirms the most common SVs in unique euchromatin are now sequence resolved. We report a ninefold SV bias toward the last 5 Mbp of human chromosomes with nearly 55\% of all VNTRs (variable number of tandem repeats) mapping to this portion of the genome. We identify SVs affecting coding and noncoding regulatory loci improving annotation and interpretation of functional variation. These data provide the framework to construct a canonical human reference and a resource for developing advanced representations capable of capturing allelic diversity.},

The analysis of CUB is not only helpful in evolutionary biology but also in improving the expression level of exogenous genes in the host cell by codon optimization. The overall nucleotide composition analysis demonstrated an unequal distribution of four nucleobases and T\% was the highest in all seven species. The genes were AT-rich, evident from overall low GC content. In addition, third codon position analysis indicated that in four Bombina species namely, Bombina fortinuptialis, Bombina lichuanensis, Bombina maxima, Bombina microdeladigitora, nucleobase A3/T3 was the preferred one, whereas A3/C3 was favored in Bombina bombina, Bombina orientalis, and Bombina variegata. Influence of mutation pressure on codon distribution and codon bias was evident from correlation analysis. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that compositional bias driven by mutation pressure along with natural selection acted on CUB of mitochondrial genes. Neutrality plot revealed that natural selection played a major role whereas mutation pressure had a minor but significant role. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that closely linked species belonging to the same genus were noticeably separated in different clades.},

While substantially fewer eukaryotic genomes are available for analyses the number is rapidly increasing. This mini-review summarizes broadly evolutionary dynamics of base composition in the different domains of life from the perspective of prokaryotes. Common and different evolutionary mechanisms influencing genomic base composition in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are discussed. The conclusion from the data currently available suggests that while there are similarities there are also striking differences in how genomic base composition has evolved within prokaryotes and eukaryotes. For instance, homologous recombination appears to increase GC content locally in eukaryotes due to a non-selective process termed GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). For prokaryotes on the other hand, increase in genomic GC content seems to be driven by the environment and selection. We find that similar phenomena observed for some organisms in each respective domain may be caused by very different mechanisms: while gBGC and recombination rates appear to explain the negative correlation between GC3 (GC content based on the third codon nucleotides) and genome size in some eukaryotes uptake of AT rich DNA sequences is the main reason for a similar negative correlation observed in prokaryotes. We provide further examples that indicate that base composition in prokaryotes and eukaryotes have evolved under very different constraints.},

Because the structure of the pedigree is what determines patterns of relatedness in modern genetic variation, our aim is to thus provide intuition for how these processes leave an imprint in genetic data.

However, a systematic investigation of the accuracy of the predictions of these methods remains missing. Here, we present the results of such a study using synthetic noisy data of a negative auto-regulatory transcriptional feedback loop, one of the most common building blocks of complex gene regulatory networks. We study the error in parameter estimation as a function of (i) number of cells in each sample; (ii) the number of time points; (iii) the highest-order moment of protein fluctuations used for inference; (iv) the moment-closure method used for likelihood approximation. We find that for sample sizes typical of flow cytometry experiments, parameter estimation by maximizing the likelihood is as accurate as using Bayesian methods but with a much reduced computational time. We also show that the choice of moment-closure method is the crucial factor determining the maximum achievable accuracy of moment-based inference methods. Common likelihood approximation methods based on the linear noise approximation or the zero cumulants closure perform poorly for feedback loops with large protein\textendash DNA binding rates or large protein bursts; this is exacerbated for highly heterogeneous cell populations. By contrast, approximating the likelihood using the linear-mapping approximation or conditional derivative matching leads to highly accurate parameter estimates for a wide range of conditions.},

Nevertheless, the discovery of SVs based on short DNA sequence reads from next-generation DNA sequence methods is still error-prone, suffering from low sensitivity and high false discovery. These shortcomings can be partially overcome with the use of long reads, but the current expense precludes their application for routine clinical diagnostics. Structural Variation genotyping, on the other hand, offers cost-effective application as diagnostic tool in the clinic, with potentially no false positives and low occurrence of false negatives.                                   Results             We assess five state- of-the- art SV genotyping software methods that test short read sequence data. These methods are characterized based on their ability to genotype certain SV types and size ranges. Furthermore, we analyze their applicability to parse different VCF file sub-formats, or to rely on specific meta information that is not always at hand. We compare the SV genotyping methods across a range of simulated and real data including SVs that were not found with Illumina data alone. We assess their sensitivity and ability to filter out initial false discovery calls to assess their reliability.

Plants and animals, despite their remarkable morphological and physiological differences, share many basic cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms. Alternative splicing (AS) is one such gene regulatory mechanism that modulates gene expression in multiple ways. It is now well established that AS is prevalent in all multicellular eukaryotes including plants and humans. Emerging evidence indicates that in plants, as in animals, transcription and splicing are coupled. Here, we reviewed recent evidence in support of co-transcriptional splicing in plants and highlighted similarities and differences between plants and humans. An unsettled question in the field of AS is the extent to which splice isoforms contribute to protein diversity. To take a critical look at this question, we presented a comprehensive summary of the current status of research in this area in both plants and humans, discussed limitations with the currently used approaches and suggested improvements to current methods and alternative approaches. We end with a discussion on the potential role of epigenetic modifications and chromatin state in splicing memory in plants primed with stresses.},

  abstract = {Significance             Evolution is change in the genetic composition of populations. In nature, individuals reproduce, die, and move among populations, leading to changes in the population frequency of the alleles they carry. Here we study an extensive family tree (pedigree) for an exhaustively sampled natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays to directly characterize the mechanisms underlying how genetic material is transmitted to future generations. We link individual fitness with long-term genetic contributions and quantify the relative roles of evolutionary processes governing allele frequency change. This study clearly illustrates how short-term evolutionary change occurs within a natural population.           ,                             A central goal of population genetics is to understand how genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow shape allele frequencies through time. However, the actual processes underlying these changes\textemdash variation in individual survival, reproductive success, and movement\textemdash are often difficult to quantify. Fully understanding these processes requires the population pedigree, the set of relationships among all individuals in the population through time. Here, we use extensive pedigree and genomic information from a long-studied natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays (               Aphelocoma coerulescens               ) to directly characterize the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping patterns of genetic variation through time. We performed gene dropping simulations to estimate individual genetic contributions to the population and model drift on the known pedigree. We found that observed allele frequency changes are generally well predicted by accounting for the different genetic contributions of founders. Our results show that the genetic contribution of recent immigrants is substantial, with some large allele frequency shifts that otherwise may have been attributed to selection actually due to gene flow. We identified a few SNPs under directional short-term selection after appropriately accounting for gene flow. Using models that account for changes in population size, we partitioned the proportion of variance in allele frequency change through time. Observed allele frequency changes are primarily due to variation in survival and reproductive success, with gene flow making a smaller contribution. This study provides one of the most complete descriptions of short-term evolutionary change in allele frequencies in a natural population to date.},

Traditional genotype imputation methods are typically based on haplotype-clustering algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs), and statistical inference. Deep learning-based methods have been recently reported to suitably address the missing data problems in various fields. To explore the performance of deep learning for genotype imputation, in this study, we propose a deep model called a sparse convolutional denoising autoencoder (SCDA) to impute missing genotypes. We constructed the SCDA model using a convolutional layer that can extract various correlation or linkage patterns in the genotype data and applying a sparse weight matrix resulted from the L1 regularization to handle high dimensional data. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of the SCDA model in different scenarios for genotype imputation on the yeast and human genotype data, respectively. Our results showed that SCDA has strong robustness and significantly outperforms popular reference-free imputation methods. This study thus points to another novel application of deep learning models for missing data imputation in genomic studies.},

  abstract = {The transition to a terrestrial environment, termed terrestrialization, is generally regarded as a pivotal event in the evolution and diversification of the land plant flora that changed the surface of our planet. Through phylogenomic studies, a group of streptophyte algae, the Zygnematophyceae, have recently been recognized as the likely sister group to land plants (embryophytes). Here, we report genome sequences and analyses of two early diverging Zygnematophyceae (Spirogloea muscicola gen. nov. and Mesotaenium endlicherianum) that share the same subaerial/terrestrial habitat with the earliest-diverging embryophytes, the bryophytes. We provide evidence that genes (i.e., GRAS and PYR/PYL/RCAR) that increase resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in land plants, in particular desiccation, originated or expanded in the common ancestor of Zygnematophyceae and embryophytes, and were gained by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from soil bacteria. These two Zygnematophyceae genomes represent a cornerstone for future studies to understand the underlying molecular mechanism and process of plant terrestrialization.},

  abstract = {Background: Synonymous mutations do not change amino acids but do sometimes change the tRNAs (anticodons) that decode a particular codon. An isoaccepting codon is a synonymous codon that shares the same tRNA. If a mutated codon could base pair with the same anticodon as the original, the mutation is termed an isoaccepting mutation. An interesting but less-studied type of codon bias is codon co-occurrence bias. There is a trend to cluster the isoaccepting codons in the genome. The proposed advantage of codon co-occurrence bias is that the tRNA released from the ribosome E site could be quickly recharged and subsequently decode the following isoaccepting codons. This advantage would enhance translation efficiency. In plant species, whether there are signals of positive selection on isoaccepting mutations in the codon co-occurred regions has not been studied. Results: We termed polymorphic mutations in coding regions using publicly available RNA-seq data in maize (Zea mays). Next, we classified all synonymous mutations into three categories according to the context, i.e., the relationship between the focal codon and the previous codon, as follows: isoaccepting, nonisoaccepting and nonsynonymous. We observed higher fractions of isoaccepting mutations in the isoaccepting context. If we looked at the minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum, the isoaccepting mutations have a higher MAF in the isoaccepting context than that in other regions, and accordingly, the nonisoaccepting mutations have a higher MAF in the nonisoaccepting context. Conclusion: Our results indicate that in regions with codon co-occurrence bias, natural selection maintains this pattern by suppressing the nonisoaccepting mutations. However, if the consecutive codons are nonisoaccepting, mutations tend to switch these codons to become isoaccepting. Our study demonstrates that the codon co-occurrence bias in the maize genome is selectively maintained by natural selection and that the advantage of this trend could potentially be the rapid recharging and reuse of tRNAs to increase translation efficiency.},

Furthermore, we observe the general nature of an instantaneous phenotypic selection process upon bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotic treatment, as well as an amino acid synthesis pathway enzyme under a range of auxotrophic conditions. To explain this phenomenon, we propose an analogy to Ohm's law in electricity (V=IR) where fitness pressure acts similarly to voltage (V), gene expression to current (I), and resistance (R) to cellular machinery constraints. Lastly, mathematical modelling approaches reveal that the emergent gene expression mechanism requires variation in mRNA and protein production within an isogenic population, and cell `memory' from positive feedbacks between growth and expression of any fitness-inducing gene.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Genotyping of sequence variants typically involves, as a first step, the alignment of sequencing reads to a linear reference genome. Because a linear reference genome represents only a small fraction of all the DNA sequence variation within a species, reference allele bias may occur at highly polymorphic or divergent regions of the genome. Graph-based methods facilitate the comparison of sequencing reads to a variation-aware genome graph, which incorporates a collection of non-redundant DNA sequences that segregate within a species. We compared the accuracy and sensitivity of graph-based sequence variant genotyping using the Graphtyper software to two widelyused methods, i.e., GATK and SAMtools, which rely on linear reference genomes using whole-genome sequencing data from 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We discovered 21,140,196, 20,262,913, and 20,668,459 polymorphic sites using GATK, Graphtyper, and SAMtools, respectively. Comparisons between sequence variant genotypes and microarray-derived genotypes showed that Graphtyper outperformed both GATK and SAMtools in terms of genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity, and non-reference discrepancy. The sequence variant genotypes that were obtained using Graphtyper had the smallest number of Mendelian inconsistencies between sequence-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in nine sire-son pairs. Genotype phasing and imputation using the Beagle software improved the quality of the sequence variant genotypes for all the tools evaluated, particularly for animals that were sequenced at low coverage. Following imputation, the concordance between sequence- and microarray-derived genotypes was almost identical for the three methods evaluated, i.e., 99.32, 99.46, and 99.24\% for GATK, Graphtyper, and SAMtools, respectively. Variant filtration based on commonly used criteria improved genotype concordance slightly but it also decreased sensitivity. Graphtyper required considerably more computing resources than SAMtools but less than GATK. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Sequence variant genotyping using Graphtyper is accurate, sensitive and computationally feasible in cattle. Graph-based methods enable sequence variant genotyping from variation-aware reference genomes that may incorporate cohort-specific sequence variants, which is not possible with the current implementation of state-of-theart methods that rely on linear reference genomes.},

However, not much information is available on the structure and evolutionary role of TEs in the Passifloraceae family (Malpighiales order). Against this backdrop, we identified, characterized, and inferred the potential genomic impact of the TE repertoire found in the available genomic resources for Passiflora edulis, a tropical fruit species. A total of 250 different TE sequences were identified (96\% Class I, and 4\% Class II), corresponding to\,\textasciitilde\,19\% of the P. edulis draft genome. TEs were found preferentially in intergenic spaces (70.4\%), but also overlapping genes (30.6\%). LTR-RTs accounted for 181 single elements corresponding to\,\textasciitilde\,13\% of the draft genome. A phylogenetic inference of the reverse transcriptase domain of the LTR-RT revealed association of 37 elements with the Copia superfamily (Angela, Ale, Tork, and Sire) and 128 with the Gypsy (Del, Athila, Reina, CRM, and Galadriel) superfamily, and Del elements were the most frequent. Interestingly, according to insertion time analysis, the majority (95.9\%) of the LTR-RTs were recently inserted into the P. edulis genome ({$<$}\,2.0 Mya), and with the exception of the Athila lineage, all LTR-RTs are transcriptionally active. Moreover, functional analyses disclosed that the Angela, Del, CRM and Tork lineages are conserved in wild Passiflora species, supporting the idea of a common expansion of Copia and Gypsy superfamilies. Overall, this is the first study describing the P. edulis TE repertoire, and it also lends weight to the suggestion that LTR-RTs had a recent expansion into the analyzed gene-rich region of the P. edulis genome, possibly along WGD (Whole genome duplication) events, but are under negative selection due to their potential deleterious impact on gene regions.},

Empirical evidence indicates that many reports of MR studies do not clearly state or examine the various assumptions of MR methods and report insufficient details on the data sources, which makes it hard to evaluate the quality and reliability of the results. The STROBE-MR guidance covers both one sample and two sample MR studies. At present, the draft checklist consists of 20 items, organized into the title and abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles.           As these guidelines aim to reach the entire MR community, we would like to give everyone the opportunity to contribute their comments. The following draft of the STROBE-MR checklist is open for public discussion and all feedback will be taken into account during its next revision. For feedback, please use the comment section below this post on PeerJ Preprints.

  abstract = {Abstract           Traditionally, the functional analysis of gene expression data has used pathway and network enrichment algorithms. These methods are usually gene rather than transcript centric and hence fall short to unravel functional roles associated to posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms such as Alternative Splicing (AS) and Alternative PolyAdenylation (APA), jointly referred here as Alternative Transcript Processing (AltTP). Moreover, short-read RNA-seq has serious limitations to resolve full-length transcripts, further complicating the study of isoform expression. Recent advances in long-read sequencing open exciting opportunities for studying isoform biology and function. However, there are no established bioinformatics methods for the functional analysis of isoform-resolved transcriptomics data to fully leverage these technological advances. Here we present a novel framework for Functional Iso-Transcriptomics analysis (FIT). This framework uses a rich isoform-level annotation database of functional domains, motifs and sites \textendash both coding and non-coding- and introduces novel analysis methods to interrogate different aspects of the functional relevance of isoform complexity. The Functional Diversity Analysis (FDA) evaluates the variability at the inclusion/exclusion of functional domains across annotated transcripts of the same gene. Parameters can be set to evaluate if AltTP partially or fully disrupts functional elements. FDA is a measure of the potential of a multiple isoform transcriptome to have a functional impact. By combining these functional labels with expression data, the Differential Analysis Module evaluates the relative contribution of transcriptional (i.e. gene level) and post-transcriptional (i.e. transcript/protein levels) regulation on the biology of the system. Measures of isoform relevance such as Minor Isoform Filtering, Isoform Switching Events and Total Isoform Usage Change contribute to restricting analysis to biologically meaningful changes. Finally, novel methods for Differential Feature Inclusion, Co-Feature Inclusion, and the combination of UTR-lengthening with Alternative Polyadenylation analyses carefully dissects the contextual regulation of functional elements resulting from differential isoforms usage. These methods are implemented in the software tappAS, a user-friendly Java application that brings FIT to the hands of non-expert bioinformaticians supporting several model and non-model species. tappAS complements statistical analyses with powerful browsing tools and highly informative gene/transcript/CDS graphs.           We applied tappAS to the analysis of two mouse Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs) and Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells (OPCs) whose transcriptome was defined by PacBio and quantified by Illumina. Using FDA we confirmed the high potential of AltTP regulation in our system, in which 90\% of multi-isoform genes presented variation in functional features at the transcript or protein level. The Differential Analysis module revealed a high interplay between transcriptional and AltTP regulation in neural development, mainly controlled by differential expression, but where AltTP acts the main driver of important neural development biological mechanisms such as vesicle trafficking, signal transduction and RNA processing. The DFI analysis revealed that, globally, AltTP increased the availability of functional features in differentiated neural cells. DFI also showed that AltTP is a mechanism for altering gene function by changing cellular localization and binding properties of proteins, via the differential inclusion of NLS, transmembrane domains or DNA binding motifs, for example. Some of these findings were experimentally validated by others and us.           In summary, we propose a novel framework for the functional analysis of transcriptomes at isoform resolution. We anticipate the tappAS tool will be an important resource for the adoption of the Functional Iso-Transcriptomics analysis by functional genomics community.},

Unambiguous molecular diagnostics of TRE disorders is hampered by current technical limitations imposed by traditional PCR and DNA sequencing methods. Here we report a novel pipeline for TRE variant diagnosis employing the massively parallel sequencing (MPS) combined with an opensource software package (FDSTools), which together are designed to distinguish true STR sequences from STR sequencing artifacts. We show that this approach can improve TRE diagnosis, such as Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). OPMD is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the PABPN1 gene. A short GCN expansion, (GCN[10]), coding for a 10 alanine repeat is not pathogenic, but an alanine expansion is pathogenic. Applying this novel procedure in a Dutch OPMD patient cohort, we found expansion variants from GCN[11] to GCN[16], with the GCN[16] as the most abundant variant. The repeat expansion length did not correlate with clinical features. However, symptom severity was found to correlate with age and with the initial affected muscles, suggesting that aging and muscle-specific factors can play a role in modulating OPMD.},

In recent years, the detection of editing sites has been improved through the availability of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technologies. Accurate bioinformatics pipelines are essential for the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to ensure the correct identification of edited sites. Several pipelines, using various read mappers and variant callers with a wide range of adjustable parameters, are available for the detection of RNA editing events. In this review, we discuss some of the most recent and popular tools and provide guidelines for RNA-Seq data generation and analysis for the detection of RNA editing in massive transcriptome data. Using simulated and real data sets, we provide an overview of their behavior, emphasizing the fact that the RNA editing detection in NGS data sets remains a challenging task.},

  abstract = {Background: The human genome contains ``dark'' gene regions that cannot be adequately assembled or aligned using standard short-read sequencing technologies, preventing researchers from identifying mutations within these gene regions that may be relevant to human disease. Here, we identify regions with few mappable reads that we call dark by depth, and others that have ambiguous alignment, called camouflaged. We assess how well long-read or linked-read technologies resolve these regions. Results: Based on standard whole-genome Illumina sequencing data, we identify 36,794 dark regions in 6054 gene bodies from pathways important to human health, development, and reproduction. Of these gene bodies, 8.7\% are completely dark and 35.2\% are {$\geq$} 5\% dark. We identify dark regions that are present in protein-coding exons across 748 genes. Linked-read or long-read sequencing technologies from 10x Genomics, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reduce dark protein-coding regions to approximately 50.5\%, 35.6\%, and 9.6\%, respectively. We present an algorithm to resolve most camouflaged regions and apply it to the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. We rescue a rare ten-nucleotide frameshift deletion in CR1, a top Alzheimer's disease gene, found in disease cases but not in controls. Conclusions: While we could not formally assess the association of the CR1 frameshift mutation with Alzheimer's disease due to insufficient sample-size, we believe it merits investigating in a larger cohort. There remain thousands of potentially important genomic regions overlooked by short-read sequencing that are largely resolved by longread technologies.},

Epistasis is defined as specific when a mutation exclusively influences the phenotypic effect of another mutation, often at physically interacting residues. In contrast, nonspecific epistasis results when a mutation is influenced by a large number of nonlocal mutations. As most mutations are pleiotropic, the in vivo folding probability\textemdash governed by basal protein stability\textemdash is thought to determine activity-enhancing mutational tolerance, implying that nonspecific epistasis is dominant. However, evidence exists for both specific and nonspecific epistasis as the prevalent factor, with limited comprehensive data sets to support either claim. Here, we use deep mutational scanning to probe how in vivo enzyme folding probability impacts local fitness landscapes. We computationally designed two different variants of the amidase AmiE with statistically indistinguishable catalytic efficiencies but lower probabilities of folding in vivo compared with wildtype. Local fitness landscapes show slight alterations among variants, with essentially the same global distribution of fitness effects. However, specific epistasis was predominant for the subset of mutations exhibiting positive sign epistasis. These mutations mapped to spatially distinct locations on AmiE near the initial mutation or proximal to the active site. Intriguingly, the majority of specific epistatic mutations were codon dependent, with different synonymous codons resulting in fitness sign reversals. Together, these results offer a nuanced view of how protein folding probability impacts local fitness landscapes and suggest that transcriptional\textendash translational effects are as important as stability in determining evolutionary outcomes.},

To examine the dual role of ROS as harmful oxidants and/or crucial cellular signals, this review elaborates that (i) how plants sense and respond to ROS in various subcellular organelles and (ii) the dynamics of subsequent ROS-induced signaling processes. The recent understanding of crosstalk between various cellular compartments in mediating their redox state spatially and temporally is discussed. Emphasis on the beneficial effects of ROS in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, regulating diverse cellular functions, and activating acclimation responses in plants exposed to abiotic and biotic stresses are described.

Concomitant with this flood of data, theoretical and methodological advances have sought to extract information from genomic sequences to infer demographic events such as population size changes and gene flow among closely related populations/species, construct recombination maps, and uncover loci underlying recent adaptation. To date, most methods make use of only one or a few summaries of the input sequences and therefore ignore potentially useful information encoded in the data. The most sophisticated of these approaches involve likelihood calculations, which require theoretical advances for each new problem, and often focus on a single aspect of the data (e.g., only allele frequency information) in the interest of mathematical and computational tractability. Directly interrogating the entirety of the input sequence data in a likelihood-free manner would thus offer a fruitful alternative. Here, we accomplish this by representing DNA sequence alignments as images and using a class of deep learning methods called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to make population genetic inferences from these images. We apply CNNs to a number of evolutionary questions and find that they frequently match or exceed the accuracy of current methods. Importantly, we show that CNNs perform accurate evolutionary model selection and parameter estimation, even on problems that have not received detailed theoretical treatments. Thus, when applied to population genetic alignments, CNNs are capable of outperforming expert-derived statistical methods and offer a new path forward in cases where no likelihood approach exists.},

By performing GWAS on the diallel panel, we found that associated variants with low frequency in the initial population are overrepresented and explain a fraction of the phenotypic variance as well as an effect size similar to common variants.

Abstract\hspace{0.6em} As our understanding of complex crop genomes continues to grow, there is growing evidence that structural genome variation plays a major role in determining traits important for breeding and agriculture. Identifying the extent and impact of structural variants in crop genomes is becoming increasingly feasible with ongoing advances in the sophistication of genome sequencing technologies, particularly as it becomes easier to generate accurate long sequence reads on a genomewide scale. In this article, we discuss the origins of structural genome variation in crops from ancient and recent genome duplication and polyploidization events and review high-throughput methods to assay such variants in crop populations in order to find associations with phenotypic traits. There is increasing evidence from such studies that gene presence\textendash absence and copy number variation resulting from segmental chromosome exchanges may be at the heart of adaptive variation of crops to counter abiotic and biotic stress factors. We present examples from major crops that demonstrate the potential of pangenomic diversity as a key resource for future plant breeding for resilience and sustainability.},

Here we show that the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has a complex pan-genomic architecture, which includes a core set of 45,000 genes shared by all individuals plus a surprisingly high number of dispensable genes (\textasciitilde 15,000). The latter are subject to presence/absence variation (PAV), i.e., they may be entirely missing in a given individual and, when present, they are frequently found as a single copy. The enrichment of dispensable genes in survival functions suggests an adaptive value for PAV, which might be the key to explain the extraordinary capabilities of adaptation and invasiveness of this species. Our study underpins a unique metazoan pan-genome architecture only previously described in prokaryotes and in a few nonmetazoan eukaryotes, but that might also characterize other marine invertebrates.},

However, to date, there is no comprehensive hypothesis on the mechanism that might have generated the degeneracy as we observe it. Here, we provide a new theory that explains the origin of the degeneracy based only on symmetry principles. The approach allows one to describe exactly the degeneracy of the early code (progenitor of the genetic code of LUCA, the last universal common ancestor) which is hypothesized to have the same degeneracy as the present vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. The theory is based upon the tessera code, that fits as the progenitor of the early code. Moreover, we describe in detail the possible evolutionary transitions implied by our theory. The approach is supported by a unified mathematical framework that accounts for the degeneracy properties of both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic codes. Our work provides a new perspective to the understanding of the origin of the genetic code and the roles of symmetry principles in the organization of genetic information.},

  abstract = {Background: Difficulty in detecting rare variants is one of the problems in conventional genome wide association studies (GWAS). The problem is closely related to the complex gene compositions comprising multiple alleles, such as haplotypes. Several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. These methods, however, have been rarely discussed in connection with haplotypes. In this study, we developed a novel SNP-set GWAS method named ``RAINBOW'' and applied the method to haplotype-based GWAS by regarding a haplotype block as a SNP-set. Combining haplotype block estimation and SNP-set GWAS, haplotype-based GWAS can be conducted without prior information of haplotypes. Results: We prepared 100 datasets of simulated phenotypic data and real marker genotype data of Oryza sativa subsp. indica, and performed GWAS of the datasets. We compared the power of our method, the conventional single-SNP GWAS, the conventional haplotype-based GWAS, and the conventional SNP-set GWAS. The results of the comparison indicated that the proposed method was able to better control false positives than the others. The proposed method was also excellent at detecting causal variants without relying on the linkage disequilibrium if causal variants were genotyped in the dataset. Moreover, the proposed method showed greater power than the other methods, i.e., it was able to detect causal variants that were not detected by the others, especially when the causal variants were located very close to each other and the directions of their effects were opposite. Conclusion: The proposed method, RAINBOW, is especially superior in controlling false positives, detecting causal variants, and detecting nearby causal variants with opposite effects. By using the SNP-set approach as the proposed method, we expect that detecting not only rare variants but also genes with complex mechanisms, such as genes with multiple causal variants, can be realized. RAINBOW was implemented as the R package and is available at https://github.com/KosukeHamazaki/RAINBOW.},

Many highly convergent adaptations are also complex, which makes their repeated emergence surprising. In plants, the evolutionary history of two carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) \textemdash{} C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis \textemdash{} presents such a paradox. Both of these modifications of ancestral C3 photosynthesis require the integration of multiple anatomical and biochemical components, yet together they have evolved more than one hundred times. The presence of CCM enzymes in all plants suggests that a rudimentary CCM might emerge via relatively few genetic changes in potentiated lineages. Here, we propose that many of the complexities often associated with C4 and CAM photosynthesis may have evolved during a post-emergence optimization phase. The ongoing development of new model clades for young, emerging CCMs is enabling the comparative studies needed to test these ideas.},

We also demonstrate how replicating training sets allows a more precise detection of CNVs, even identifying novel CNVs in two genomes previously surveyed thoroughly for CNVs using long read data.},

  abstract = {Adaptive archaic hominin genes                            As they migrated out of Africa and into Europe and Asia, anatomically modern humans interbred with archaic hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The result of this genetic introgression on the recipient populations has been of considerable interest, especially in cases of selection for specific archaic genetic variants. Hsieh               et al.               characterized adaptive structural variants and copy number variants that are likely targets of positive selection in Melanesians. Focusing on population-specific regions of the genome that carry duplicated genes and show an excess of amino acid replacements provides evidence for one of the mechanisms by which genetic novelty can arise and result in differentiation between human genomes.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaax2083                        ,              Melanesians carry adaptive DNA variants derived from archaic hominins.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Characterizing genetic variants underlying local adaptations in human populations is one of the central goals of evolutionary research. Most studies have focused on adaptive single-nucleotide variants that either arose as new beneficial mutations or were introduced after interbreeding with our now-extinct relatives, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. The adaptive role of copy number variants (CNVs), another well-known form of genomic variation generated through deletions or duplications that affect more base pairs in the genome, is less well understood, despite evidence that such mutations are subject to stronger selective pressures.                                         RATIONALE               This study focuses on the discovery of introgressed and adaptive CNVs that have become enriched in specific human populations. We combine whole-genome CNV calling and population genetic inference methods to discover CNVs and then assess signals of selection after controlling for demographic history. We examine 266 publicly available modern human genomes from the Simons Genome Diversity Project and genomes of three ancient hominins\textemdash a Denisovan, a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains in Siberia, and a Neanderthal from Croatia. We apply long-read sequencing methods to sequence-resolve complex CNVs of interest specifically in the Melanesians\textemdash an Oceanian population distributed from Papua New Guinea to as far east as the islands of Fiji and known to harbor some of the greatest amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestry.                                         RESULTS                                Consistent with the hypothesis of archaic introgression outside Africa, we find a significant excess of CNV sharing between modern non-African populations and archaic hominins (                 P                 = 0.039). Among Melanesians, we observe an enrichment of CNVs with potential signals of positive selection (                 n                 = 37 CNVs), of which 19 CNVs likely introgressed from archaic hominins. We show that Melanesian-stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signals of positive selection (                 P                 = 0.0323). Many map near or within genes associated with metabolism (e.g.,                 ACOT1                 and                 ACOT2                 ), development and cell cycle or signaling (e.g.,                 TNFRSF10D                 and                 CDK11A                 and                 CDK11B                 ), or immune response (e.g.,                 IFNLR1                 ). We characterize two of the largest and most complex CNVs on chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 that introgressed from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively, and are absent from most other human populations. At chromosome 16p11.2, we sequence-resolve a large duplication of {$>$}383 thousand base pairs (kbp) that originated from Denisovans and introgressed into the ancestral Melanesian population 60,000 to 170,000 years ago. This large duplication occurs at high frequency ({$>$}79\%) in diverse Melanesian groups, shows signatures of positive selection, and maps adjacent to                 Homo sapiens                 \textendash specific duplications that predispose to rearrangements associated with autism. On chromosome 8p21.3, we identify a Melanesian haplotype that carries two CNVs, a \textasciitilde 6-kbp deletion, and a \textasciitilde 38-kbp duplication, with a Neanderthal origin and that introgressed into non-Africans 40,000 to 120,000 years ago. This CNV haplotype occurs at high frequency (44\%) and shows signals consistent with a partial selective sweep in Melanesians. Using long-read sequencing genomic and transcriptomic data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history for these two CNVs and discover previously undescribed duplicated genes (                 TNFRSF10D1                 ,                 TNFRSF10D2                 , and                 NPIPB16                 ) that show an excess of amino acid replacements consistent with the action of positive selection.                                                        CONCLUSION               Our results suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation that is absent from current reference genomes.

The magnifying glasses highlight structural differences between the archaic (top) and reference (bottom) genomes. Neanderthal (red) and Denisovan (blue) haplotypes encompassing large CNVs occur at high frequencies in Melanesians (44 and 79\%, respectively) but are absent (black) in all non-Melanesians. These CNVs create positively selected genes (                     TNFRSF10D1                     ,                     TNFRSF10D2                     ,                                          and                     NPIPB16                     ) that are absent from the reference genome.                                                                                            ,              Copy number variants (CNVs) are subject to stronger selective pressure than single-nucleotide variants, but their roles in archaic introgression and adaptation have not been systematically investigated. We show that stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signatures of positive selection in Melanesians and provide evidence for adaptive introgression of large CNVs at chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively. Using long-read sequence data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history of these polymorphisms and show that both encode positively selected genes absent from most human populations. Our results collectively suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation.},

Motivated by modern applications, we consider the case of many groups of random effects, where each group corresponds to a variance component. When the number of variance components is large, fitting a logistic linear mixed model is challenging. Thus, we develop two efficient and stable minorization\textendash maximization (MM) algorithms for estimating variance components based on a Laplace approximation of the logistic model. One of these leads to a simple iterative soft-thresholding algorithm for variance component selection using the maximum penalized approximated likelihood. We demonstrate the variance component estimation and selection performance of our algorithms by means of simulation studies and an analysis of real data.},

  abstract = {Training deep neural networks with the error backpropagation algorithm is considered implausible from a biological perspective. Numerous recent publications suggest elaborate models for biologically plausible variants of deep learning, typically defining success as reaching around 98\% test accuracy on the MNIST data set. Here, we investigate how far we can go on digit (MNIST) and object (CIFAR10) classification with biologically plausible, local learning rules in a network with one hidden layer and a single readout layer. The hidden layer weights are either fixed (random or random Gabor filters) or trained with unsupervised methods (Principal/Independent Component Analysis or Sparse Coding) that can be implemented by local learning rules. The readout layer is trained with a supervised, local learning rule. We first implement these models with rate neurons. This comparison reveals, first, that unsupervised learning does not lead to better performance than fixed random projections or Gabor filters for large hidden layers. Second, networks with localized receptive fields perform significantly better than networks with all-to-all connectivity and can reach backpropagation performance on MNIST. We then implement two of the networks \textendash{} fixed, localized, random \& random Gabor filters in the hidden layer \textendash{} with spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and spike timing dependent plasticity to train the readout layer. These spiking models achieve {$>$}98.2\% test accuracy on MNIST, which is close to the performance of rate networks with one hidden layer trained with backpropagation. The performance of our shallow network models is comparable to most current biologically plausible models of deep learning. Furthermore, our results with a shallow spiking network provide an important reference and suggest the use of data sets other than MNIST for testing the performance of future models of biologically plausible deep learning.},

The model is based on some key experimental observations and well established facts. It emphasizes the role of lactate as a substrate, as well as the central role of pyruvate in the regulation of the metabolism. The simulations show how imposed environmental constraints and imposed energy requirements push the cell to adapt its metabolism to sustain its needs. The results highlight the cooperativeness of the two metabolic modes and allows to revisit the notions of             metabolic switch             and             metabolic reprogramming             . Our results thus tend to show that the Warburg effect is not an inherent characteristic of the tumor cell, but a spontaneous and transitory adaptation mechanism to a disturbed environment. This means that the tumor cell metabolism is not fundamentally different from that of a normal cell. This has implications on the way therapies are being considered. The quest to normalize the tumor acidity could be a good strategy.                                   Author Summary             Cancer cells metabolism focuses the interest of the cancer research community. Although this process is intensely studied experimentally, there exists very few theoretical models that tackle this issue. One main reason is the extraordinary complexity of the metabolism that involves many inter-related regulation networks which makes it illusory to recreate computationally this complexity. In this study we propose a simplified model of the metabolism which focuses on the interrelation of the three main energetic metabolites that are oxygen, glucose and lactate with the aim to better understand the dynamic of the core system of the glycolysis-OXPHOS relationship. However simple, the model highlights the main rules that allow the cell to dynamically adapt its metabolism to its changing environment. It moreover allows to address this impact at the tissue scale. Simulations performed in a spheroid exhibit non-trivial spatial heterogeneity of the energy metabolism. It further reveals that the metabolic features that are commonly assigned to cancer cells are not necessarily due to cell intrinsic abnormality. They can emerge spontaneously because of the disregulated over-acidic environment.},

To help with data management and storage, we developed a sorghum Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) pangenome database that stores all identified haplotypes and variant information for a given set of individuals. We developed two PHGs in sorghum, one with 24 individuals and another with 398 individuals, that reflect the diversity across genic regions of the sorghum genome. 24 founders of the Chibas sorghum breeding program were sequenced at low coverage (0.01x) and processed through the PHG to identify genome-wide variants. The PHG called SNPs with only 5.9\% error at 0.01x coverage - only 3\% lower than its accuracy when calling SNPs from 8x coverage sequence. Additionally, 207 progeny from the Chibas genomic selection (GS) training population were sequenced and processed through the PHG. Missing genotypes in the progeny were imputed from the parental haplotypes available in the PHG and used for genomic prediction. Mean prediction accuracies with PHG SNP calls range from 0.57-0.73 for different traits, and are similar to prediction accuracies obtained with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) or markers from sequencing targeted amplicons (rhAmpSeq). This study provides a proof of concept for using a sorghum PHG to call and impute SNPs from low-coverage sequence data and also shows that the PHG can unify genotype calls from different sequencing platforms. By reducing the amount of input sequence needed, the PHG has the potential to decrease the cost of genotyping for genomic selection, making GS more feasible and facilitating larger breeding populations that can capture maximum recombination. Our results demonstrate that the PHG is a useful research and breeding tool that can maintain variant information from a diverse group of taxa, store sequence data in a condensed but readily accessible format, unify genotypes from different genotyping methods, and provide a cost-effective option for genomic selection for any species.},

But the chemical effects of PS introduction as a redox active site into DNA (S-DNA) is still poorly understood. Herein, we perform time-resolved spectroscopy to examine the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the PS oxidation by potent radicals in free model, in dinucleotide, and in S-oligomer. The crucial sulphur-centered hemi-bonded intermediates P\textendash S{$\therefore$}S\textendash P- were observed and found to play critical roles leading to the stable adducts of -P\textendash S\textendash S\textendash P-, which are backbone DNA lesion products. Moreover, the oxidation of the PS moiety in dinucleotides d[GPSG], d[APSA], d[GPSA], d[APSG] and in S-oligomers was monitored in real-time, showing that PS oxidation can compete with adenine but not with guanine. Significantly, hole transfer process from A+\textbullet{} to PS and concomitant -P\textendash S{$\therefore$}S\textendash P- formation was observed, demonstrating the base-to-backbone hole transfer unique to S-DNA, which is different from the normally adopted backbone-to-base hole transfer in native DNA. These findings reveal the distinct backbone lesion pathway brought by the PS modification and also imply an alternative -P\textendash S{$\therefore$}S\textendash P-/-P\textendash S\textendash S\textendash P- pathway accounting for the interesting protective role of PS as an oxidation sacrifice in bacterial genome.},

  abstract = {Genomic variations in a reference collection are naturally represented as genome variation graphs. Such graphs encode common subsequences as vertices and the variations are captured using additional vertices and directed edges. The resulting graphs are directed graphs possibly with cycles. Existing algorithms for aligning sequences on such graphs make use of partial order alignment (POA) techniques that work on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To achieve this, acyclic extensions of the input graphs are first constructed through expensive loop unrolling steps (DAGification). Furthermore, such graph extensions could have considerable blowup in their size and in the worst case the blow-up factor is proportional to the input sequence length. We provide a novel alignment algorithm V-ALIGN that aligns the input sequence directly on the input graph while avoiding such expensive DAGification steps. V-ALIGN is based on a novel dynamic programming (DP) formulation that allows gapped alignment directly on the input graph. It supports affine and linear gaps. We also propose refinements to V-ALIGN for better performance in practice. With the proposed refinements, the time to fill the DP table has linear dependence on the sizes of the sequence, the graph, and its feedback vertex set. We conducted experiments to compare the proposed algorithm against the existing POA-based techniques. We also performed alignment experiments on the genome variation graphs constructed from the 1000 Genomes data. For aligning short sequences, standard approaches restrict the expensive gapped alignment to small filtered subgraphs having high similarity to the input sequence. In such cases, the performance of VALIGN for gapped alignment on the filtered subgraph depends on the subgraph sizes.},

Although a number of existing SV detection algorithms can detect many types of SVs using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, no single algorithm can call every type of SVs with high precision and high recall. Results: We comprehensively evaluate the performance of 69 existing SV detection algorithms using multiple simulated and real WGS datasets. The results highlight a subset of algorithms that accurately call SVs depending on specific types and size ranges of the SVs and that accurately determine breakpoints, sizes, and genotypes of the SVs. We enumerate potential good algorithms for each SV category, among which GRIDSS, Lumpy, SVseq2, SoftSV, Manta, and Wham are better algorithms in deletion or duplication categories. To improve the accuracy of SV calling, we systematically evaluate the accuracy of overlapping calls between possible combinations of algorithms for every type and size range of SVs. The results demonstrate that both the precision and recall for overlapping calls vary depending on the combinations of specific algorithms rather than the combinations of methods used in the algorithms. Conclusion: These results suggest that careful selection of the algorithms for each type and size range of SVs is required for accurate calling of SVs. The selection of specific pairs of algorithms for overlapping calls promises to effectively improve the SV detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {The fitness effects of synonymous mutations, nucleotide changes that do not alter the encoded amino acid, have often been assumed to be neutral, but a growing body of evidence suggests otherwise. We used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with direct measures of competitive fitness to estimate the distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations for a gene under directional selection and capable of adapting via synonymous nucleotide changes. Synonymous mutations had highly variable fitness effects, both deleterious and beneficial, resembling those of nonsynonymous mutations in the same gene. This variation in fitness was underlain by changes in transcription linked to the creation of internal promoter sites. A positive correlation between fitness and the presence of synonymous substitutions across a phylogeny of related Pseudomonads suggests these mutations may be common in nature. Taken together, our results provide the most compelling evidence to date that synonymous mutations with non-neutral fitness effects may in fact be commonplace.},

  abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites with major impacts on host genome architecture and host adaptation. A proper evaluation of their evolutionary significance has been hampered by the paucity of short scale phylogenetic comparisons between closely related species. Here, we characterized the dynamics of TE accumulation at the micro-evolutionary scale by comparing two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis lyrata and A. halleri. Results: Joint genome annotation in these two outcrossing species confirmed that both contain two distinct populations of TEs with either `recent' or `old' insertion histories. Identification of rare segregating insertions suggests that diverse TE families contribute to the ongoing dynamics of TE accumulation in the two species. Orthologous TE fragments (i.e. those that have been maintained in both species), tend to be located closer to genes than those that are retained in one species only. Compared to non-orthologous TE insertions, those that are orthologous tend to produce fewer short interfering RNAs, are less heavily methylated when found within or adjacent to genes and these tend to have lower expression levels. These findings suggest that long-term retention of TE insertions reflects their frequent acquisition of adaptive roles and/or the deleterious effects of removing nearly neutral TE insertions when they are close to genes. Conclusion: Our results indicate a rapid evolutionary dynamics of the TE landscape in these two outcrossing species, with an important input of a diverse set of new insertions with variable propensity to resist deletion.},

ZmPTF1, a phosphate starvationinduced basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, contributes to root development and low-phosphate tolerance in maize. Here, ZmPTF1 expression, drought tolerance, and the underlying mechanisms were studied by using maize ZmPTF1 overexpression lines and mutants. ZmPTF1 was found to be a positive regulator of root development, ABA synthesis, signalling pathways, and drought tolerance. ZmPTF1 was also found to bind to the G-box element within the promoter of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), C-repeat-binding factor (CBF4), ATAF2/NAC081, NAC30, and other transcription factors, and to act as a positive regulator of the expression of those genes. The dramatically upregulated NCEDs led to increased abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis and activation of the ABA signalling pathway. The up-regulated transcription factors hierarchically regulate the expression of genes involved in root development, stress responses, and modifications of transcriptional regulation. The improved root system, increased ABA content, and activated ABA-, CBF4-, ATAF2-, and NAC30-mediated stress responses increased the drought tolerance of the ZmPTF1 overexpression lines, while the mutants showed opposite trends. This study describes a useful gene for transgenic breeding and helps us understand the role of a bHLH protein in plant root development and stress responses.},

Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure\textemdash often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.},

Deleterious mutations in both species were prevalent in pericentromeric regions, enriched in non-syntenic genes, and present at low allele frequencies. A comparison of deleterious burden between sorghum and maize revealed that sorghum, in contrast to maize, departed from the ``domestication cost'' hypothesis that predicts a higher deleterious burden among domesticates compared to wild lines. Additionally, sorghum and maize population genetic summary statistics were used to predict a gene deleterious index with an accuracy higher than 0.5. This research represents a key step towards understanding the evolutionary dynamics of deleterious variants in sorghum and provides a comparative genomics framework to start prioritizing them for removal through genome editing and breeding.},

Moreover, since the mapping of long error-prone reads to ETR remains an open problem, it is not clear how to polish draft ETR assemblies. To address these problems, we developed the tandemMapper tool for mapping reads to ETRs and the tandemQUAST tool for polishing ETR assemblies and their quality assessment. We demonstrate that tandemQUAST not only reveals errors in and evaluates ETR assemblies, but also improves them.

While the human genome harbors hundreds of thousands of TRs, analysis of TR expansions has been mainly limited to known pathogenic loci. A major challenge is that expanded repeats are beyond the read length of most nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) datasets and are not profiled by existing genome-wide tools. We present GangSTR, a novel algorithm for genome-wide genotyping of both short and expanded TRs. GangSTR extracts information from paired-end reads into a unified model to estimate maximum likelihood TR lengths. We validate GangSTR on real and simulated data and show that GangSTR outperforms alternative methods in both accuracy and speed. We apply GangSTR to a deeply sequenced trio to profile the landscape of TR expansions in a healthy family and validate novel expansions using orthogonal technologies. Our analysis reveals that healthy individuals harbor dozens of long TR alleles not captured by current genome-wide methods. GangSTR will likely enable discovery of novel disease-associated variants not currently accessible from NGS.},

  abstract = {Significance                            The mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation to changing environments in species with reduced genetic variation, referred to as the ``genetic paradox of invasion,'' are unknown. We report that transposable elements (TEs) are highly enriched in the gene promoter regions of               Capsella rubella               compared with its outcrossing sister species               Capsella grandiflora               . We also show that a number of polymorphic TEs in               C. rubella               are associated with changes in gene expression. Frequent TE insertions at               FLOWERING LOCUS C               of               C. rubella               affect flowering-time variation, an important life history trait correlated with fitness. These results indicate that TE insertions drive rapid phenotypic variation, which could potentially help adapting to novel environments in species with limited genetic variation.                        ,                             Rapid phenotypic changes in traits of adaptive significance are crucial for organisms to thrive in changing environments. How such phenotypic variation is achieved rapidly, despite limited genetic variation in species that experience a genetic bottleneck is unknown.               Capsella rubella               , an annual and inbreeding forb (Brassicaceae), is a great system for studying this basic question. Its distribution is wider than those of its congeneric species, despite an extreme genetic bottleneck event that severely diminished its genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate that transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genetic variation that could account for its high phenotypic diversity. TEs are (               i               ) highly enriched in               C. rubella               compared with its outcrossing sister species               Capsella grandiflora               , and (               ii               ) 4.2\% of polymorphic TEs in               C. rubella               are associated with variation in the expression levels of their adjacent genes. Furthermore, we show that frequent TE insertions at               FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)               in natural populations of               C. rubella               could explain 12.5\% of the natural variation in flowering time, a key life history trait correlated with fitness and adaptation. In particular, we show that a recent TE insertion at the 3{${'}$} UTR of               FLC               affects mRNA stability, which results in reducing its steady-state expression levels, to promote the onset of flowering. Our results highlight that TE insertions can drive rapid phenotypic variation, which could potentially help with adaptation to changing environments in a species with limited standing genetic variation.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic units able to move within the genome of virtually all organisms. Due to their natural repetitive numbers and their high structural diversity, the identification and classification of TEs remain a challenge in sequenced genomes. Although TEs were initially regarded as ``junk DNA'', it has been demonstrated that they play key roles in chromosome structures, gene expression, and regulation, as well as adaptation and evolution. A highly reliable annotation of these elements is, therefore, crucial to better understand genome functions and their evolution. To date, much bioinformatics software has been developed to address TE detection and classification processes, but many problematic aspects remain, such as the reliability, precision, and speed of the analyses. Machine learning and deep learning are algorithms that can make automatic predictions and decisions in a wide variety of scientific applications. They have been tested in bioinformatics and, more specifically for TEs, classification with encouraging results. In this review, we will discuss important aspects of TEs, such as their structure, importance in the evolution and architecture of the host, and their current classifications and nomenclatures. We will also address current methods and their limitations in identifying and classifying TEs.},

  abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the most common repeated sequences in eukaryotic genomes. Recent studies demonstrated their deep impact on species diversity, adaptation to the environment and diseases. Although there are many conventional bioinformatics algorithms for detecting and classifying TEs, none have achieved reliable results on different types of TEs. Machine learning (ML) techniques can automatically extract hidden patterns and novel information from labeled or non-labeled data and have been applied to solving several scientific problems. Methodology: We followed the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process, applying the six stages of the review protocol from it, but added a previous stage, which aims to detect the need for a review. Then search equations were formulated and executed in several literature databases. Relevant publications were scanned and used to extract evidence to answer research questions. Results: Several ML approaches have already been tested on other bioinformatics problems with promising results, yet there are few algorithms and architectures available in literature focused specifically on TEs, despite representing the majority of the nuclear DNA of many organisms. Only 35 articles were found and categorized as relevant in TE or related fields. Conclusions: ML is a powerful tool that can be used to address many problems. Although ML techniques have been used widely in other biological tasks, their utilization in TE analyses is still limited. Following the SLR, it was possible to notice that the use of ML for TE analyses (detection and classification) is an open problem, and this new field of research is growing in interest.},

Current assemblies traverse transposable elements (TEs) and provide an opportunity for comprehensive annotation of TEs. Numerous methods exist for annotation of each class of TEs, but their relative performances have not been systematically compared. Moreover, a comprehensive pipeline is needed to produce a non-redundant library of TEs for species lacking this resource to generate whole-genome TE annotations. Results: We benchmark existing programs based on a carefully curated library of rice TEs. We evaluate the performance of methods annotating long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, terminal inverted repeat (TIR) transposons, short TIR transposons known as miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs), and Helitrons. Performance metrics include sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, FDR, and F1. Using the most robust programs, we create a comprehensive pipeline called Extensive de-novo TE Annotator (EDTA) that produces a filtered non-redundant TE library for annotation of structurally intact and fragmented elements. EDTA also deconvolutes nested TE insertions frequently found in highly repetitive genomic regions. Using other model species with curated TE libraries (maize and Drosophila), EDTA is shown to be robust across both plant and animal species. Conclusions: The benchmarking results and pipeline developed here will greatly facilitate TE annotation in eukaryotic genomes. These annotations will promote a much more in-depth understanding of the diversity and evolution of TEs at both intra- and inter-species levels.

  abstract = {Background: DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification, which is involved in many biological processes, including gene expression regulation, embryonic development, cell differentiation and genomic imprinting etc. And it also involves many key regulatory genes in eukaryotes. By tracing the evolutionary history of methylation-related genes, we can understand the origin and expansion time of these genes, which helps to understand the evolutionary history of plants, and we can also understand the changes of DNA methylation patterns in different species. However, most studies on the evolution of methylation-related genes failed to be carried out for the whole DNA methylation pathway. Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive identification of 33 methylation-related genes in 77 species, and investigated gene origin and evolution throughout the plant kingdom. We found that the origin of genes responsible for methylation maintenance and demethylation evolved early, while most de novo methylation-related genes appeared late. The methylation-related genes were expanded by whole genome duplication and tandem replication, but were also accompanied by a large number of gene absence events in different species. The gene length and intron length varied a lot in different species, but exon structure and functional domains were relatively conserved. The phylogenetic relationships of methylation-related genes were traced to reveal the evolution history of DNA methylation in different species. The expression patterns of methylation-related genes have changed during the evolution of species, and the expression patterns of these genes in different species can be clustered into four categories. Conclusions: The study describes a global characterization of DNA methylation-related genes in the plant kingdom. The similarities and differences in origin time, gene structure and phylogenetic relationship of these genes lead us to understand the evolutionary conservation and dynamics of DNA methylation in plants.},

These methods are based on counting frequencies of short k-mer sequences, thus allowing faster and more robust analysis compared to traditional alignment-based methods. Results: We have created a fast alignment-free method, AluMine, to analyze polymorphic insertions of Alu elements in the human genome. We tested the method on 2,241 individuals from the Estonian Genome Project and identified 28,962 potential polymorphic Alu element insertions. Each tested individual had on average 1,574 Alu element insertions that were different from those in the reference genome. In addition, we propose an alignment-free genotyping method that uses the frequency of insertion/deletion-specific 32-mer pairs to call the genotype directly from raw sequencing reads. Using this method, the concordance between the predicted and experimentally observed genotypes was 98.7\%. The running time of the discovery pipeline is approximately 2 h per individual. The genotyping of potential polymorphic insertions takes between 0.4 and 4 h per individual, depending on the hardware configuration. Conclusions: AluMine provides tools that allow discovery of novel Alu element insertions and/or genotyping of known Alu element insertions from personal genomes within few hours.},

  abstract = {RNA-protein interactions are inevitably existing in many fundamental biological processes of organisms and it is an effective method to investigate the nature of RNA-protein interactions through crosslinking induced by photoactivation. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect the crucial transient intermediates to elucidate the mechanism of photo crosslinking between RNA and proteins, which will shed light on regulating the crosslinking sites as well as the favorable cross-linked amino acids. In this research, we choose the photoactivatable ribonucleotide analog, 4-thiouracil, and the aromatic amino acid, tryptophan, as a model system to study, from which the photo crosslinking is found to be initiated by the electron transfer as the first step. By means of the nanosecond time-resolved laser flash photolysis, the key intermediates of photo-induced electron transfer from tryptophan to the triplet of 4-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil anion radical (4-TU\textbullet －)and tryptophan cation radical (TrpH\textbullet ＋) are observed, as well as the deprotonated species of tryptophan neutral radical (Trp\textbullet ). By monitoring the 4-TU triplet decay kinetics, the pseudo-first order rate constant of photo-induced electron transfer is determined to be 2.88\texttimes 109 L\textbullet mol－1\textbullet s－1 and found to be diffusion-controlled. The pH-effect on the electron transfer and proton transfer have been further examined. In addition, the driving force for electron transfer from tryptophan to 4-TU triplet is estimated using the classic Rehm-Weller empirical equation to be －0.15 eV, which means the photo-induced electron transfer process is favorable thermodynamically. These results demonstrate that photo-induced electron transfer between 4-thiouracil triplet and tryptophan is the key step, which can trigger the following proton transfer and radical coupling processes and lead to the covalent photoadducts. These studies provide a basis for mechanistic understandings of photo crosslinking between RNA and proteins in more complex system.},

  abstract = {Background Germline DNA copy number variation (CNV) is a ubiquitous source of genetic variation and remains largely unexplored in association with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. Methods CNV was quantified in the DNA of approximately 3500 cases and controls genotyped with the Illumina 610k and HumanOmni2.5M arrays. We performed a genome-wide association study of common ({$>$}1\%) CNV regions (CNVRs) with EOC and high-grade serous (HGSOC) risk and, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), performed in silico analyses of tumor-gene expression. Results Three CNVRs were associated (P{$<$}0.01) with EOC risk: two large (\textasciitilde 100kb) regions within the 610k set and one small ({$<$}5kb) region with the higher resolution 2.5M data. Large CNVRs included a duplication at LILRA6 (OR=2.57, P=0.001) and a deletion at CYP2A7 (OR=1.90, P=0.007) that was strongly associated with HGSOC risk (OR=3.02, P=8.98x10-5). Somatic CYP2A7 alterations correlated with EGLN2 expression in tumors (P=2.94x10-47). An intronic ERBB4/HER4 deletion was associated with reduced EOC risk (OR=0.33, P=9.5x10-2) and somatic deletions correlated with ERBB4 downregulation (P=7.05x10-5). Five CNVRs were associated with HGSOC including two reduced-risk deletions: one at 1p36.33 (OR=0.28, P=0.001) that correlated with lower CDKIIA expression in TCGA tumors (P=2.7x10-7), and another at 8p21.2 (OR=0.52, P=0.002) that was present somatically where it correlated with lower GNRH1 expression (P=5.9x10-5). Conclusions Though CNV appears to not contribute largely to EOC susceptibility, a number of low-tocommon frequency variants may influence the risk of EOC and tumor gene expression. Impact Further research on CNV and EOC susceptibility is warranted, particularly with CNVs estimated from high-density arrays.},

CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications.

To understand variation in gene regulatory networks activated by submergence, we conducted a high-resolution analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression at three scales of transcript control in four angiosperms, ranging from a dryland-adapted wild species to a wetland crop. The data define a cohort of conserved submergence-activated genes with signatures of overlapping cis regulation by four transcription factor families. Syntenic genes are more highly expressed than nonsyntenic genes, yet both can have the cis motifs and chromatin accessibility associated with submergence up-regulation. Whereas the flexible circuitry spans the eudicot-monocot divide, the frequency of specific cis motifs, extent of chromatin accessibility, and degree of submergence activation are more prevalent in the wetland crop and may have adaptive importance.},

Suppression of COs by large, cytologically visible inversions and translocations has long been recognized, but relatively little is known about how smaller structural variants (SVs) affect COs. To examine fine-scale determinants of the CO landscape, including SVs, we used a rapid, cost-effective method for high-throughput sequencing to generate a precise map of over 17,000 COs between the Col-0 and Ler accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. COs were generally suppressed in regions with SVs, but this effect did not depend on the size of the variant region, and was only marginally affected by the variant type. CO suppression did not extend far beyond the SV borders, and CO rates were slightly elevated in the flanking regions. Disease resistance gene clusters, which often exist as SVs, exhibited high CO rates at some loci, but there was a tendency toward depressed CO rates at loci where large structural differences exist between the two parents. Our high-density map also revealed in fine detail how CO positioning relates to genetic (DNA motifs) and epigenetic (chromatin structure) features of the genome. We conclude that suppression of COs occurs over a narrow region spanning large and small-scale SVs, representing influence on the CO landscape in addition to sequence and epigenetic variation along chromosomes.},

However, current bioinformatics tools for alternative splicing analysis from RNA-seq data are not user-friendly, disregard available exon-exon junction quantification or have limited downstream analysis features. To overcome such limitations, we have developed psichomics, an R package with an intuitive graphical interface for alternative splicing quantification and downstream dimensionality reduction, differential splicing and gene expression and survival analyses based on The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, the Sequence Read Archive project and user-provided data. These integrative analyses can also incorporate clinical and molecular sample-associated features.

  abstract = {Genome engineering is a biotechnological approach to precisely modify the genetic code of a given organism in order to change the context of an existing sequence or to create new genetic resources, e.g., for obtaining improved traits or performance. Efficient targeted genome alterations are mainly based on the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or adjacent single-strand breaks (SSBs). Naturally, all organisms continuously have to deal with DNA-damaging factors challenging the genetic integrity, and therefore a wide range of DNA repair mechanisms have evolved. A profound understanding of the different repair pathways is a prerequisite to control and enhance targeted gene modifications. DSB repair can take place by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-dependent repair (HDR). As the main outcome of NHEJ-mediated repair is accompanied by small insertions and deletions, it is applicable to specifically knock out genes or to rearrange linkage groups or whole chromosomes. The basic requirement for HDR is the presence of a homologous template; thus this process can be exploited for targeted integration of ectopic sequences into the plant genome. The development of different types of artificial site-specific nucleases allows for targeted DSB induction in the plant genome. Such synthetic nucleases have been used for both qualitatively studying DSB repair in vivo with respect to mechanistic differences and quantitatively in order to determine the role of key factors for NHEJ and HR, respectively. The conclusions drawn from these studies allow for a better understanding of genome evolution and help identifying synergistic or antagonistic genetic interactions while supporting biotechnological applications for transiently modifying the plant DNA repair machinery in favor of targeted genome engineering.},

  abstract = {Summary: Support Vector Machines with gapped k-mer kernels (gkm-SVMs) have been used to learn predictive models of regulatory DNA sequence. However, interpreting predictive sequence patterns learned by gkm-SVMs can be challenging. Existing interpretation methods such as deltaSVM, in-silico mutagenesis (ISM) or SHAP either do not scale well or make limiting assumptions about the model that can produce misleading results when the gkm kernel is combined with nonlinear kernels. Here, we propose GkmExplain: a computationally efficient feature attribution method for interpreting predictive sequence patterns from gkm-SVM models that has theoretical connections to the method of Integrated Gradients. Using simulated regulatory DNA sequences, we show that GkmExplain identifies predictive patterns with high accuracy while avoiding pitfalls of deltaSVM and ISM and being orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than SHAP. By applying GkmExplain and a recently developed motif discovery method called TF-MoDISco to gkm-SVM models trained on in vivo transcription factor (TF) binding data, we recover consolidated, non-redundant TF motifs. Mutation impact scores derived using GkmExplain consistently outperform deltaSVM and ISM at identifying regulatory genetic variants from gkm-SVM models of chromatin accessibility in lymphoblastoid cell-lines.},

Because research has typically focused on single abundant families or summarized TEs at a coarse taxonomic level, our knowledge about how these lineages differ in their effects on genome evolution is still rudimentary.

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) make up a large and rapidly evolving proportion of plant genomes. Among Class II DNA TEs, TIR elements are flanked by characteristic terminal inverted repeat sequences (TIRs). TIR TEs may play important roles in genome evolution, including generating allelic diversity, inducing structural variation, and regulating gene expression. However, TIR TE identification and annotation has been hampered by the lack of effective tools, resulting in erroneous TE annotations and a significant underestimation of the proportion of TIR elements in the maize genome. This problem has largely limited our understanding of the impact of TIR elements on plant genome structure and evolution. In this paper, we propose a new method of TIR element detection and annotation. This new pipeline combines the advantages of current homology-based annotation methods with powerful de novo machine-learning approaches, resulting in greatly increased efficiency and accuracy of TIR element annotation. The results show that the copy number and genome proportion of TIR elements in maize is much larger than that of current annotations. In addition, the distribution of some TIR superfamily elements is reduced in centromeric and pericentromeric positions, while others do not show a similar bias. Finally, the incorporation of machine-learning techniques has enabled the identification of large numbers of new DTA (hAT) family elements, which have all the hallmarks of bona fide TEs yet which lack high homology with currently known DTA elements. Together, these results provide new tools for TE research and new insight into the impact of TIR elements on maize genome diversity.},

So far about 100 nuclear encoded proteins have been characterized as RNA editing factors in plant organelles. Respective RNA editing mutants reduce or lose editing activity at different sites and display various macroscopic phenotypes from pale or albino in the case of chloroplasts to growth retardation or even embryonic lethality. Therefore, RNA editing mutants can be a useful resource of surrogate mutants for organellar encoded genes, especially for mitochondrially encoded genes that it is so far unfeasible to manipulate. However, connections between RNA editing defects and observed phenotypes in the mutants are often hard to elucidate, since RNA editing factors often target multiple RNA sites in different genes simultaneously. In this review article, we summarize the physiological aspects of respective RNA editing mutants and discuss them as surrogate mutants for functional analysis of mitochondrially encoded genes.},

Here, we present a machine learning method, CorrTest, to detect the presence of rate autocorrelation in large phylogenies. CorrTest is computationally efficient and performs better than the available state-of-the-art method. Application of CorrTest reveals extensive rate autocorrelation in DNA and amino acid sequence evolution of mammals, birds, insects, metazoans, plants, fungi, parasitic protozoans, and prokaryotes. Therefore, rate autocorrelation is a common phenomenon throughout the tree of life.

  abstract = {Background: The genetic bases of many complex phenotypes are still largely unknown, mostly due to the polygenic nature of the traits and the small effect of each associated mutation. An alternative approach to classic association studies to determining such genetic bases is an evolutionary framework. As sites targeted by natural selection are likely to harbor important functionalities for the carrier, the identification of selection signatures in the genome has the potential to unveil the genetic mechanisms underpinning human phenotypes. Popular methods of detecting such signals rely on compressing genomic information into summary statistics, resulting in the loss of information. Furthermore, few methods are able to quantify the strength of selection. Here we explored the use of deep learning in evolutionary biology and implemented a program, called ImaGene, to apply convolutional neural networks on population genomic data for the detection and quantification of natural selection. Results: ImaGene enables genomic information from multiple individuals to be represented as abstract images. Each image is created by stacking aligned genomic data and encoding distinct alleles into separate colors. To detect and quantify signatures of positive selection, ImaGene implements a convolutional neural network which is trained using simulations. We show how the method implemented in ImaGene can be affected by data manipulation and learning strategies. In particular, we show how sorting images by row and column leads to accurate predictions. We also demonstrate how the misspecification of the correct demographic model for producing training data can influence the quantification of positive selection. We finally illustrate an approach to estimate the selection coefficient, a continuous variable, using multiclass classification techniques. Conclusions: While the use of deep learning in evolutionary genomics is in its infancy, here we demonstrated its potential to detect informative patterns from large-scale genomic data. We implemented methods to process genomic data for deep learning in a user-friendly program called ImaGene. The joint inference of the evolutionary history of mutations and their functional impact will facilitate mapping studies and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with human phenotypes.},

In plants, disease resistance is often conferred by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, intracellular immune receptors that recognize pathogen proteins and their effects on the host. Consistent with extensive balancing and positive selection, NLRs are encoded by one of the most variable gene families in plants, but the true extent of intraspecific NLR diversity has been unclear. Here, we define a nearly complete species-wide panNLRome in Arabidopsis thaliana based on sequence enrichment and long-read sequencing. The panNLRome largely saturates with approximately 40 well-chosen wild strains, with half of the panNLRome being present in most accessions. We chart NLR architectural diversity, identify new architectures, and quantify selective forces that act on specific NLRs and NLR domains. Our study provides a blueprint for defining pan-NLRomes.},

Current bioinformatic analysis pipelines fail to take adequate account of the possible splicing effects of such variants, particularly where variants fall outwith canonical splice site sequences, and consequently the pathogenicity of such variants may often be missed. The regulation of splicing is highly complex and as a result, in silico prediction tools lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for reliable use. Variants of all kinds can be linked to aberrant splicing in disease and the need for correct identification and diagnosis grows ever more crucial as novel splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide therapies start to enter clinical usage. RT-PCR provides a useful targeted assay of the splicing effects of identified variants, while minigene assays, massive parallel reporter assays and animal models can also be used for more detailed study of a particular splicing system, given enough time and resources. However, RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) has the potential to be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in genomic medicine. By utilising data science approaches and machine learning, it may prove possible to finally understand and interpret the `splicing code' and apply this knowledge in human disease diagnostics.},

DNA from both ancient and historic contexts yielded high proportions of endogenous DNA, and although archaeological DNA was found to be highly degraded, it still provided sufficient coverage to analyze genetic changes over time. Shotgun sequencing data from specimens from the Eden's Bluff archaeological site in Arkansas yielded organellar DNA sequence from specimens up to 3,100 years old. Their sequences match those of modern cultivated sunflowers and are consistent with an early domestication bottleneck in this species. Our findings also suggest that recent breeding of sunflowers has led to a loss of genetic diversity that was present only a century ago in Native American landraces. These breeding episodes also left a profound signature on the mitochondrial and plastid haplotypes in cultivars, as two types were intentionally introduced from other Helianthus species for crop improvement. These findings gained from ancient and historic sunflower specimens underscore how future in-\-depth gene-\-based analyses can advance our understanding of the pace and targets of selection during the domestication of sunflower and other crop species.},

The functionality of these motifs is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, the methylation levels at the MM and UM motifs are respectively higher and lower than the genomic background. Second, these motifs are enriched at the binding sites of methylation modifying enzymes including DNMT3A and TET1, indicating their possible roles of recruiting these enzymes. Third, these motifs significantly overlap with ``somatic QTLs" (quantitative trait loci) of methylation and expression. Fourth, disruption of these motifs by mutation is associated with significantly altered methylation level of the CpGs in the neighbor regions. Furthermore, these motifs together with somatic mutations are predictive of cancer subtypes and patient survival. We revealed some of these motifs were also associated with histone modifications, suggesting a possible interplay between the two types of epigenetic modifications. We also found some motifs form feed forward loops to contribute to DNA methylation dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        In flowering plants, the haploid male gametophyte (pollen) is essential for sperm delivery, double fertilization, and subsequent initiation of seed development. Pollen also undergoes dynamic epigenetic regulation of expression from transposable elements (TEs), but how this process interacts with gene regulation and function is not clearly understood. To identify components of these processes, we quantified transcript levels in four male reproductive stages of maize (tassel primordia, microspores, mature pollen, and isolated sperm cells) via RNA-seq. We found that, in contrast to Arabidopsis TE expression in pollen, TE transcripts in maize accumulate as early as the microspore stage and are also present in sperm cells. Intriguingly, coordinated expression was observed between the most highly expressed protein-coding genes and neighboring TEs, specifically in both mature pollen and sperm cells. To test the hypothesis that such elevated expression correlates with functional relevance, we measured the fitness cost (male-specific transmission defect) of GFP-tagged exon insertion mutations in over 50 genes highly expressed in pollen vegetative cell, sperm cell, or seedling (as a sporophytic control). Insertions in genes highly expressed only in seedling or primarily in sperm cells (with one exception) exhibited no difference from the expected 1:1 transmission ratio. In contrast, insertions in over 20\% of vegetative cell genes were associated with significant reductions in fitness, showing a positive correlation of transcript level with non-Mendelian segregation. The             gamete expressed2             (             gex2             ) gene was the single sperm cell gene associated with reduced transmission when mutant ({$<$}35\% for two independent insertions), and also triggered seed defects when crossed as a male, supporting a role for             gex2             in double fertilization. Overall, our study demonstrates a developmentally programmed and coordinated transcriptional activation of TEs and genes, and further identifies maize pollen as a model in which transcriptomic data have predictive value for quantitative phenotypes.                                   Author Summary                            In flowering plants, pollen is essential for delivering sperm cells to the egg and central cell for double fertilization, initiating the process of seed development. In plants with abundant pollen like maize, this process can be highly competitive. In an added layer of complexity, growing evidence indicates expression of transposable elements (TEs) is more dynamic in pollen than in other plant tissues. How these elements impact pollen function and gene regulation is not well understood. We used transcriptional profiling to generate a framework for both detailed analysis of TE expression and quantitative assessment of gene function during maize pollen development. TEs are expressed early and persist, many showing coordinate activation with highly-expressed neighboring genes in the pollen vegetative cell and sperm cells. Measuring fitness costs for a set of over 50 mutations indicates a correlation between elevated transcript level and gene function in the vegetative cell. Finally, we establish a role in fertilization for the               gamete expressed2               (               gex2               ) gene, identified based on its specific expression in sperm cells. These results highlight maize pollen as a powerful model for investigating the developmental interplay of TEs and genes, as well as for measuring fitness contributions of specific genes.},

In this article, we propose, implement, and test two methods to control for and utilize evolutionary relatedness within a predictive deep learning framework. The methods are tested and applied within the context of predicting mRNA expression levels from whole-genome DNA sequence data and are applicable across biological organisms. Potential use cases for the methods include plant and animal breeding, disease research, gene editing, and others.           ,                             Deep learning methodologies have revolutionized prediction in many fields and show potential to do the same in molecular biology and genetics. However, applying these methods in their current forms ignores evolutionary dependencies within biological systems and can result in false positives and spurious conclusions. We developed two approaches that account for evolutionary relatedness in machine learning models: (               i               ) gene-family\textendash guided splitting and (               ii               ) ortholog contrasts. The first approach accounts for evolution by constraining model training and testing sets to include different gene families. The second approach uses evolutionarily informed comparisons between orthologous genes to both control for and leverage evolutionary divergence during the training process. The two approaches were explored and validated within the context of mRNA expression level prediction and have the area under the ROC curve (auROC) values ranging from 0.75 to 0.94. Model weight inspections showed biologically interpretable patterns, resulting in the hypothesis that the 3{${'}$} UTR is more important for fine-tuning mRNA abundance levels while the 5{${'}$} UTR is more important for large-scale changes.},

An experimental model for multicellularity is the myxobacteria, which swarm and cooperate to form fruiting bodies in soil. Wielgoss               et al.               studied lineages of wild-caught myxobacteria. They found diversity, but also surprising genetic similarity, within fruiting bodies that was unlikely to be based on shared ancestry between them. Instead, reoccurrence of the same mutations seems to have occurred independently. These mutations have then been selected to confer similar phenotypes that converge on social behavior.

We have analyzed genomic and social-phenotype variation among 120 natural isolates of the cooperative bacterium               Myxococcus xanthus               derived from six multicellular fruiting bodies. Each fruiting body was composed of multiple lineages radiating from a unique recent ancestor. Genomic evolution was concentrated in selection hotspots associated with evolutionary change in social phenotypes. Synonymous mutations indicated that kin lineages within the same fruiting body often first diverged from a common ancestor more than 100 generations ago. Thus, selection appears to promote endemic diversification of kin lineages that remain together over long histories of local interaction, thereby potentiating social coevolution.},

Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is well suited for the integration of multiple high throughput data sources. MKL remains to be under-utilized by genomic researchers partly due to the lack of unified guidelines for its use, and benchmark genomic datasets. Results: We provide three implementations of MKL in R. These methods are applied to simulated data to illustrate that MKL can select appropriate models. We also apply MKL to combine clinical information with miRNA gene expression data of ovarian cancer study into a single analysis. Lastly, we show that MKL can identify gene sets that are known to play a role in the prognostic prediction of 15 cancer types using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as, identify new gene sets for the future research. Conclusion: Multiple kernel learning coupled with modern optimization techniques provides a promising learning tool for building predictive models based on multi-source genomic data. MKL also provides an automated scheme for kernel prioritization and parameter tuning. The methods used in the paper are implemented as an R package called RMKL package, which is freely available for download through CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMKL.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements are one of the major contributors to genome-size differences in metazoans. Despite this, relatively little is known about the evolutionary patterns of element expansions and the element families involved. Here we report a broad genomic sampling within the genus               Hydra               , a freshwater cnidarian at the focal point of diverse research in regeneration, symbiosis, biogeography, and aging. We find that the genome of               Hydra               is the result of an expansion event involving long interspersed nuclear elements and in particular a single family of the chicken repeat 1 (CR1) class. This expansion is unique to a subgroup of the genus               Hydra               , the brown hydras, and is absent in the green hydra, which has a repeat landscape similar to that of other cnidarians. These features of the genome make               Hydra               attractive for studies of transposon-driven genome expansions and speciation.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent advances in genomics have greatly increased research opportunities for non-model species. For wildlife, a growing availability of reference genomes means that population genetics is no longer restricted to a small set of anonymous loci. When used in conjunction with a reference genome, reduced-representation sequencing (RRS) provides a cost-effective method for obtaining reliable diversity information for population genetics. Many software tools have been developed to process RRS data, though few studies of non-model species incorporate genome alignment in calling loci. A commonly-used RRS analysis pipeline, Stacks, has this capacity and so it is timely to compare its utility with existing software originally designed for alignment and analysis of whole genome sequencing data. Here we examine population genetic inferences from two species for which reference-aligned reduced-representation data have been collected. Our two study species are a threatened Australian marsupial (Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii; declining population) and an Arctic-circle migrant bird (pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus; expanding population). Analyses of these data are compared using Stacks versus two widely-used genomics packages, SAMtools and GATK. We also introduce a custom R script to improve the reliability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls in all pipelines and conduct population genetic inferences for non-model species with reference genomes. Results: Although we identified orders of magnitude fewer SNPs in our devil dataset than for goose, we found remarkable symmetry between the two species in our assessment of software performance. For both datasets, all three methods were able to delineate population structure, even with varying numbers of loci. For both species, population structure inferences were influenced by the percent of missing data. Conclusions: For studies of non-model species with a reference genome, we recommend combining Stacks output with further filtering (as included in our R pipeline) for population genetic studies, paying particular attention to potential impact of missing data thresholds. We recognise SAMtools as a viable alternative for researchers more familiar with this software. We caution against the use of GATK in studies with limited computational resources or time.},

  abstract = {Significance                            In the approaching decades, food security will likely be more of an issue as there will be an increased demand for grain which will need to be met in an environmentally sustainable manner. To date, commercial transgenic maize has primarily targeted resistance to insects and herbicides. Here we describe a transgenic approach to improve the yield and yield stability of maize. We have demonstrated that increasing and extending the expression of a maize gene,               zmm28               , alters vegetative and reproductive growth parameters and significantly enhances yield in large-scale field trials conducted over multiple years. We conclude that alteration in expression of a native maize gene in maize can create a substantially positive change in a complex trait like grain yield.                        ,                             Increasing maize grain yield has been a major focus of both plant breeding and genetic engineering to meet the global demand for food, feed, and industrial uses. We report that increasing and extending expression of a maize MADS-box transcription factor gene,               zmm28               , under the control of a moderate-constitutive maize promoter, results in maize plants with increased plant growth, photosynthesis capacity, and nitrogen utilization. Molecular and biochemical characterization of               zmm28               transgenic plants demonstrated that their enhanced agronomic traits are associated with elevated plant carbon assimilation, nitrogen utilization, and plant growth. Overall, these positive attributes are associated with a significant increase in grain yield relative to wild-type controls that is consistent across years, environments, and elite germplasm backgrounds.},

We investigated the genetic differentiation between upland and lowland rice domesticated in agro-ecosystems with contrasting water\textendash soil conditions using genome-wide SNPs. We estimated morphological differences among upland and lowland rice in drought resistance and productivity through common garden experiments. Upland rice had better drought resistance but poorer productivity. The negative correlations between traits of drought resistance and productivity are attributed to the underlying genetic trade-offs through tight linkages (e.g., DCA1 and OsCesA7) or pleiotropic effects (e.g., LAX1). The genetic trade-offs are common and greatly shape the evolution of drought resistance in upland rice. In genomic regions associated with both productivity and drought resistance, signs of balancing selection were detected in upland rice, while signs of directional selection were detected in lowland rice, potentially contributing to their adaptive differentiation. Signs of balancing selection in upland rice resulted from bi-directional selection during its domestication in drought-prone upland agro-ecosystems. Using genome-wide association analysis, we identified several valuable quantitative trait loci associated with drought resistance, for which highly differentiated genes should be considered candidates. Bi-directional selection breaking tight linkages by accumulating recombination events would be applicable in breeding water-saving and droughtresistance rice.},

However, the extent of this uncoupling and the roles of DNA methylation in shaping diversity of both gene expression and phenotypes are hotly debated. Here, we investigate the genetic basis and biological functions of DNA methylation at a population scale in maize. Results: We perform targeted DNA methylation profiling for a diverse panel of 263 maize inbred genotypes. All genotypes show similar levels of DNA methylation globally, highlighting the importance of DNA methylation in maize development. Nevertheless, we identify more than 16,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are distributed across the 10 maize chromosomes. Genome-wide association analysis with high-density genetic markers reveals that over 60\% of the DMRs are not tagged by SNPs, suggesting the presence of unique information in DMRs. Strong associations between DMRs and the expression of many genes are identified in both the leaf and kernel tissues, pointing to the biological significance of methylation variation. Association analysis with 986 metabolic traits suggests that DNA methylation is associated with phenotypic variation of 156 traits. There are some traits that only show significant associations with DMRs and not with SNPs. Conclusions: These results suggest that DNA methylation can provide unique information to explain phenotypic variation in maize.},

Recently, genome assemblies for five sesame varieties including two landraces (S. indicum cv. Baizhima and Mishuozhima) and three modern cultivars (S. indicum var. Zhongzhi13, Yuzhi11 and Swetha), have become available providing a rich resource for comparative genomic analyses and gene discovery. Here, we employed a reference-assisted assembly approach to improve the draft assemblies of four of the sesame varieties. We then constructed a sesame pan-genome of 554.05 Mb. The pan-genome contained 26 472 orthologous gene clusters; 15 409 (58.21\%) of them were core (present across all five sesame genomes), whereas the remaining 41.79\% (11 063) clusters and the 15 890 variety-specific genes were dispensable. Comparisons between varieties suggest that modern cultivars from China and India display significant genomic variation. The gene families unique to the sesame modern cultivars contain genes mainly related to yield and quality, while those unique to the landraces contain genes involved in environmental adaptation. Comparative evolutionary analysis indicates that several genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction and lipid metabolism are under positive selection, which may be associated with sesame environmental adaption and selection for high seed oil content. This study of the sesame pan-genome provides insights into the evolution and genomic characteristics of this important oilseed and constitutes a resource for further sesame crop improvement.},

Depending on the level of parasitism, a proportional reduction on the plastid genome has been found. However, knowledge on gene loss and evolution of the mitogenome of parasitic plants is only available for four hemiparasitic Viscum species (Viscaceae), which lack many of the mitochondrial genes, while the remaining genes exhibit very fast molecular evolution rates. In this study, we include another genus, Phoradendron, from the Viscaceae, as well as 10 other hemiparasitic or holoparasitic taxa from across the phylogeny of the angiosperms to investigate how fast molecular evolution works on their mitogenomes, and the extent of gene loss. Results: Our observations from Viscum were replicated in Phoradendron liga, whereas the remaining parasitic plants in the study have a complete set of the core mitochondrial genes and exhibit moderate or only slightly raised substitution rates compared to most autotrophic taxa, without any statistically significant difference between the different groups (autotrophs, hemiparasites and holoparasites). Additionally, further evidence is provided for the placement of Balanophoraceae within the order Santalales, while the exact placement of Cynomoriaceae still remains elusive. Conclusions: We examine the mitochondrial gene content of 11 hemiparasitic and holoparasitic plants and confirm previous observations in Viscaceae. We show that the remaining parasitic plants do not have significantly higher substitution rates than autotrophic plants in their mitochondrial genes. We provide further evidence for the placement of Balanophoraceae in the Santalales.},

We first introduce several deep learning models and then discuss several research areas which have combined omics and deep learning in recent years. In addition, we summarize the general steps involved in using deep learning which have not yet been systematically discussed in the existent literature on this topic. Finally, we compare the features and performance of current mainstream open source deep learning frameworks and present the opportunities and challenges involved in deep learning. This survey will be a good starting point and guideline for omics researchers to understand deep learning.},

  abstract = {Chinese indigenous pigs in the Taihu Lake region are well known for their high fecundity and other excellent characteristics. To better understand the characteristics of these breeds in this area as well as to provide the government and breeders the molecular basis for formulating a reasonable conservation policy, we explored the structure of haplotype blocks and genetic diversity of the 7 populations which is relevant for the management and conservation of these important genetic resources using next-generation sequencing data. In this study, a total of 131\,300 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with minor allele frequencies {$\geqslant$}0.05 were obtained for further analysis. In general, there are similar within-breed genetic diversities (He, Ho, Pn, Ar) among these 7 pig populations in the Taihu Lake region. Average values for the inbreeding coefficients estimates in the 7 populations are 0.110 (F1), 0.056 (F2), and 0.078 (F3). All the breeds have seen a continuous decline in Ne estimates over time with FJ and SW populations having a very similar curve. Moreover, the Ne of SMS pig breeds were smaller than other Chinese pig breeds, indicating that SMS pig breeds underwent stronger selection pressure than other Chinese pig breeds. The average genetic distances among the 7 populations in the Taihu Lake region were 0.235 (MMS), 0.240 (SMS), 0.269 (EH), 0.248 (MI), 0.221 (FJ), 0.254 (JX), and 0.212 (SW). A summary of the number of haplotype blocks and haplotype diversity was also presented. This study provide a deep understanding of the current situation of conservation in this region, thereby uncovering the pertinent insight to better formulate more reasonable preservation policies for the government departments and breeding planners to follow-up.},

Many multiparental populations have recently been produced to increase genetic diversity and QTL mapping resolution. However, few software packages are available for map construction in these populations. In this paper, we build a general framework for the construction of genetic linkage maps from genotypic data in diploid populations, including bi- and multiparental populations, cross-pollinated (CP) populations, and breeding pedigrees. The framework is implemented as an automatic pipeline called magicMap, where the maximum multilocus likelihood approach utilizes genotypic information efficiently. We evaluate magicMap by extensive simulations and eight real datasets: one biparental, one CP, four multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC), and two nested association mapping (NAM) populations, the number of markers ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Not only is magicMap the only software capable of accommodating all of these designs, it is more accurate and robust to missing genotypes and genotyping errors than commonly used packages.},

  abstract = {New technologies and analysis methods are enabling genomic structural variants (SVs) to be detected with ever-increasing accuracy, resolution, and comprehensiveness. Translating these methods to routine research and clinical practice requires robust benchmark sets. We developed the first benchmark set for identification of both false negative and false positive germline SVs, which complements recent efforts emphasizing increasingly comprehensive characterization of SVs. To create this benchmark for a broadly consented son in a Personal Genome Project trio with broadly available cells and DNA, the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Consortium integrated 19 sequence-resolved variant calling methods, both alignment- and de novo assembly-based, from short-, linked-, and long-read sequencing, as well as optical and electronic mapping. The final benchmark set contains 12745 isolated, sequence-resolved insertion and deletion calls {$\geq$}50 base pairs (bp) discovered by at least 2 technologies or 5 callsets, genotyped as heterozygous or homozygous variants by long reads. The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.66 Gbp and 9641 SVs supported by at least one diploid assembly. Support for SVs was assessed using svviz with short-, linked-, and long-read sequence data. In general, there was strong support from multiple technologies for the benchmark SVs, with 90 \% of the Tier 1 SVs having support in reads from more than one technology. The Mendelian genotype error rate was 0.3 \%, and genotype concordance with manual curation was {$>$}98.7 \%. We demonstrate the utility of the benchmark set by showing it reliably identifies both false negatives and false positives in high-quality SV callsets from short-, linked-, and long-read sequencing and optical mapping. GIAB is working towards a new version of the benchmark set that will use new technologies and methods such as PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing and ultralong Oxford Nanopore sequencing to expand to more challenging genome regions and include more challenging SVs such as inversions. We are also developing a robust integration process to make calls on GRCh37 and GRCh38 for all seven GIAB samples.},

Here, we describe recombination landscape estimation using recurrent neural networks (ReLERNN), a deep learning method for estimating a genome-wide recombination map that is accurate even with small numbers of pooled or individually sequenced genomes. Rather than use summaries of linkage disequilibrium as its input, ReLERNN takes columns from a genotype alignment, which are then modeled as a sequence across the genome using a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that ReLERNN improves accuracy and reduces bias relative to existing methods and maintains high accuracy in the face of demographic model misspecification, missing genotype calls, and genome inaccessibility. We apply ReLERNN to natural populations of African Drosophila melanogaster and show that genome-wide recombination landscapes, although largely correlated among populations, exhibit important population-specific differences. Lastly, we connect the inferred patterns of recombination with the frequencies of major inversions segregating in natural Drosophila populations.},

Machine learning and artificial intelligence emerge naturally as tools for analyzing and summarizing data, supporting clinical decisions with data-driven insights and further unlocking genetically driven mechanisms underlying individualized risk. While these computational tools allow modeling of complex relations in large datasets, they pose new challenges especially because a patient's health is at stake. Due to an often black-box nature and high reliance on the training data, these new tools are prone to biases and most commonly provide correlational rather than causal insights. Results of these analyses have been difficult to validate, interpret, and explain to practitioners, and most genetic studies have struggled to encompass the full spectrum of human diversity. In this work, we summarize recent research trends in addressing these issues with examples from submissions to the ``Computational Challenges and Artificial Intelligence in Precision Medicine'' session at Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing 2021. We observe growing research interest in identifying biases, deriving causal and interpretable relations, tuning parameters of models for production, and using artificial intelligence for quality control. We expect further upsurge in work on interpretability and low-risk applications of advanced computational tools.},

Furthermore, in the genomic era, in which the number of available genomes is increasing, genome mining joined to synthetic biology are offering a significant help in drug discovery. In the present review we discuss the importance of genome mining and synthetic biology approaches to identify new natural products, also underlining considering the possible advantages and disadvantages of this technique. Moreover, we debate the associated techniques that can be applied following to genome mining for validation of data.

We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement.},

Although diverse methodologies have been developed to identify enhancers and promoters, most have tacitly assumed that these elements are distinct. However, studies have unexpectedly shown that regulatory elements may have both enhancer and promoter functions. Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements. We discuss emerging models that define regulatory elements by accessible DNA and their non-m utually-exclusive abilities to drive transcription initiation (promoter activity) and/or to enhance transcription at other such regions (enhancer activity).},

For example, the number of vertebrate genome assemblies currently in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database               4               increased by more than 50\% to 1,485 assemblies in the year from July 2018 to July 2019.

This new trend raises substantial challenges to data integration and fusion, of which the latter is a specific type of integration that applies a uniform method in a scalable manner, to solve biological problems which the multi-omics measurements target. Fusionbased analysis has advanced rapidly in the past decade, thanks to application drivers and theoretical breakthroughs in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. We will briefly address these methods from methodological and mathematical perspectives and categorize them into three types of approaches: data fusion (a narrowed definition as compared to the general data fusion concept), model fusion, and mixed fusion. We will demonstrate at least one typical example in each specific category to exemplify the characteristics, principles, and applications of the methods in general, as well as discuss the gaps and potential issues for future studies.},

However, the techniques for imputing transcriptomic traits from DNA variation remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, associations found when linking eQTL studies to complex traits through methods like PrediXcan can lead to false positives due to linkage disequilibrium between distinct causal variants. Therefore, the best prediction performance models may not necessarily lead to more reliable causal gene discovery. With the goal of improving discoveries without increasing false positives, we develop and compare multiple transcriptomic imputation approaches using the most recent GTEx release of expression and splicing data on 17,382 RNA-sequencing samples from 948 post-mortem donors in 54 tissues. We find that informing prediction models with posterior causal probability from fine-mapping (dap-g) and borrowing information across tissues (mashr ) lead to better performance in terms of number and proportion of significant associations that are colocalized and the proportion of silver standard genes identified as indicated by precision-recall and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves.

The previous state-of-the-art method Z-Hunt is based on statistical mechanical and energy considerations about B- to Z-DNA transition using sequence information. Z-DNA CHiP-seq experiment results showed little overlap with Z-Hunt predictions implying that sequence information only is not sufficient to explain emergence of Z-DNA at different genomic locations. Adding epigenetic and other functional genomic mark-ups to DNA sequence level can help revealing the functional Z-DNA sites. Here we take advantage of the deep learning approach that can analyze and extract information from large volumes of molecular biology data. We developed a machine learning approach DeepZ that aggregates information from genome-wide maps of epigenetic markers, transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding sites, and chromosome accessibility maps. With the developed model we not only verify the experimental Z-DNA predictions, but also generate the whole-genome annotation, introducing new possible Z-DNA regions, which have not yet been found in experiments and can be of interest to the researchers from various fields.},

Cancer cells have general as well as cancer type-specific and subtype-specific alterations in the splicing process that can have prognostic value and contribute to every hallmark of cancer progression, including cancer immune responses. These splicing alterations are often linked to the occurrence of cancer driver mutations in genes encoding either core components or regulators of the splicing machinery. Of therapeutic relevance, the transcriptomic landscape of cancer cells makes them particularly vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of splicing.

It addresses the crucial question for models' predictability: how accurately can the models' parameters be recovered from available experimental data. The methods based on profile likelihood are among the most reliable methods of practical identification. However, these methods are often computationally demanding or lead to inaccurate estimations of parameters' confidence intervals. Development of methods, which can accurately produce parameters' confidence intervals in reasonable computational time, is of utmost importance for Systems Biology and QSP modeling.             We propose an algorithm Confidence Intervals by Constraint Optimization (CICO) based on profile likelihood, designed to speed-up confidence intervals estimation and reduce computational cost. The numerical implementation of the algorithm includes settings to control the accuracy of confidence intervals estimates.

First, it identifies groups of genetic variants with similar causal estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Second, it performs MR robustly and efficiently in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, it has the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios.

A spatial metric for individual cells in scRNA-seq data is first established based on a map connecting it with the spatial measurements. The cell\textendash cell communications are then obtained by ``optimally transporting'' signal senders to target signal receivers in space. Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene\textendash gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells. Four datasets are employed for cross-validation of spatial gene expression prediction and comparison to known cell\textendash cell communications.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created synthetic datasets based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Finally, we applied the proposed method to mouse developmental enhancers and were able to identify the components of a known heterotypic TF cluster. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar depends on the nature of the prediction task.},

  abstract = {Synonymous mutations do not change the encoded amino acids but may alter the structure or function of an mRNA in ways that impact gene function. Advances in next generation sequencing technologies have detected numerous synonymous mutations in the human genome. Several computational models have been proposed to predict deleterious synonymous mutations, which have greatly facilitated the development of this important field. Consequently, there is an urgent need to assess the state-of-the-art computational methods for deleterious synonymous mutation prediction to further advance the existing methodologies and to improve performance. In this regard, we systematically compared a total of 10 computational methods (including specific method for deleterious synonymous mutation and general method for single nucleotide mutation) in terms of the algorithms used, calculated features, performance evaluation and software usability. In addition, we constructed two carefully curated independent test datasets and accordingly assessed the robustness and scalability of these different computational methods for the identification of deleterious synonymous mutations. In an effort to improve predictive performance, we established an ensemble model, named Prediction of Deleterious Synonymous Mutation (PrDSM), which averages the ratings generated by the three most accurate predictors. Our benchmark tests demonstrated that the ensemble model PrDSM outperformed the reviewed tools for the prediction of deleterious synonymous mutations. Using the ensemble model, we developed an accessible online predictor, PrDSM, available at http://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn:8080/ PrDSM/. We hope that this comprehensive survey and the proposed strategy for building more accurate models can serve as a useful guide for inspiring future developments of computational methods for deleterious synonymous mutation prediction.},

However, the unique features of GWAS demand that MR methods account for both linkage disequilibrium (LD) and ubiquitously existing horizontal pleiotropy among complex traits, which is the phenomenon wherein a variant affects the outcome through mechanisms other than exclusively through the exposure. Therefore, statistical methods that fail to consider LD and horizontal pleiotropy can lead to biased estimates and false-positive causal relationships. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a probabilistic model for MR analysis in identifying the causal effects between risk factors and disease outcomes using GWAS summary statistics in the presence of LD and to properly account for horizontal pleiotropy among genetic variants (MR-LDP) and develop a computationally efficient algorithm to make the causal inference. We then conducted comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of MR-LDP over the existing methods. Moreover, we used two real exposure\textendash outcome pairs to validate the results from MR-LDP compared with alternative methods, showing that our method is more efficient in using all-instrumental variants in LD. By further applying MR-LDP to lipid traits and body mass index (BMI) as risk factors for complex diseases, we identified multiple pairs of significant causal relationships, including a protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on peripheral vascular disease and a positive causal effect of BMI on hemorrhoids.},

  abstract = {In the area of genetic epidemiology, studies of the genotype-phenotype associations have made significant contributions to human complicated trait genetics. These studies depend on specialized statistical methods for uncover the association between traits and genetic variants, both common and rare variants. Often, in analyzing such studies, potentially confounding factors, such as social and environmental conditions, are required to be involved. Multiple linear regression is the most widely used type of regression analysis when the outcome of interest is quantitative traits. Many statistical tests for identifying genotype-phenotype associations using linear regression rely on the assumption that the traits (or the residuals) of the regression follow a normal distribution. In genomic research, the rankbased inverse normal transformation (INT) is one of the most popular approaches to reach normally distributed traits (or normally distributed residuals). Many researchers believe that applying the INT to the non-normality of the traits (or the non-normality of the residuals) is required for valid inference, because the phenotypic (or residual) outliers and non-normality have the significant influence on both the type I error rate control and statistical power, especially under the situation in rare-variant association testing procedures. Here we propose a test for exploring the association of the rare variant with the quantitative trait by using a fully adjusted full-stage INT. Using simulations we show that the fully adjusted full-stage INT is more appropriate than the existing INT methods, such as the fully adjusted two-stage INT and the INT-based omnibus test, in testing genotype-phenotype associations with rare variants, especially when genotypes are uncorrelated with covariates. The fully adjusted fullstage INT retains the advantages of the fully adjusted two-stage INT and ameliorates the problems of the fully adjusted two-stage INT for analysis of rare variants under non-normality of the trait. We also present theoretical results on these desirable properties. In addition, the two available methods with non-normal traits, the quantile/median regression method and the Yeo-Johnson power transformation, are also included in simulations for comparison with these desirable properties.},

  abstract = {Background: Consecutive testing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is usually employed to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits. Ideally one should model all covariates in unison, but most existing analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) perform only univariate regression. Results: We extend and efficiently implement iterative hard thresholding (IHT) for multiple regression, treating all SNPs simultaneously. Our extensions accommodate generalized linear models, prior information on genetic variants, and grouping of variants. In our simulations, IHT recovers up to 30\% more true predictors than SNP-by-SNP association testing and exhibits a 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude decrease in false-positive rates compared with lasso regression. We also test IHT on the UK Biobank hypertension phenotypes and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 cardiovascular phenotypes. We find that IHT scales to the large datasets of contemporary human genetics and recovers the plausible genetic variants identified by previous studies. Conclusions: Our real data analysis and simulation studies suggest that IHT can (i) recover highly correlated predictors, (ii) avoid over-fitting, (iii) deliver better true-positive and false-positive rates than either marginal testing or lasso regression, (iv) recover unbiased regression coefficients, (v) exploit prior information and group-sparsity, and (vi) be used with biobank-sized datasets. Although these advances are studied for genome-wide association studies inference, our extensions are pertinent to other regression problems with large numbers of predictors.},

The initial response to IFN{$\alpha$} is characterized by chromatin remodeling, followed by changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFN{$\alpha$} induces changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage, increasing the diversity of transcripts expressed by the beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may expand antigens presented by beta cells to the immune system. Beta cells also up-regulate the checkpoint proteins PDL1 and HLA-E that may exert a protective role against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis identifies two compound classes that antagonize IFN{$\alpha$} effects on human beta cells.},

  abstract = {Significance             Crop genomes can be very large, with many repetitive elements and pseudogenes. Distilling a genome down to the relatively small fraction of regions that are functionally valuable for trait variation can be like looking for needles in a haystack. The location of these regions is often not obvious, and current detection technologies are impractically expensive and intensive for many research projects. The unmethylated regions in a genome are highly stable during vegetative development and can reveal the locations of potentially expressed genes or cis-regulatory elements. This approach provides a framework toward complete annotation of genes and discovery of cis-regulatory elements using methylation profiles from only a single tissue.           ,              The genomic sequences of crops continue to be produced at a frenetic pace. It remains challenging to develop complete annotations of functional genes and regulatory elements in these genomes. Chromatin accessibility assays enable discovery of functional elements; however, to uncover the full portfolio of cis-elements would require profiling of many combinations of cell types, tissues, developmental stages, and environments. Here, we explore the potential to use DNA methylation profiles to develop more complete annotations. Using leaf tissue in maize, we define {$\sim$}100,000 unmethylated regions (UMRs) that account for 5.8\% of the genome; 33,375 UMRs are found greater than 2 kb from genes. UMRs are highly stable in multiple vegetative tissues, and they capture the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions from leaf tissue. However, many UMRs are not accessible in leaf, and these represent regions with potential to become accessible in specific cell types or developmental stages. These UMRs often occur near genes that are expressed in other tissues and are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors. The leaf-inaccessible UMRs exhibit unique chromatin modification patterns and are enriched for chromatin interactions with nearby genes. The total UMR space in four additional monocots ranges from 80 to 120 megabases, which is remarkably similar considering the range in genome size of 271 megabases to 4.8 gigabases. In summary, based on the profile from a single tissue, DNA methylation signatures provide powerful filters to distill large genomes down to the small fraction of putative functional genes and regulatory elements.},

We identify 6,906 TE insertions polymorphisms (TIPs), which result from the mobilization of 337 distinct TE families. Most TIPs are low frequency variants and TIPs are disproportionately located within or adjacent to genes involved in environmental responses. In addition, genic TE insertions tend to have strong transcriptional effects and they can notably lead to the generation of multiple transcript isoforms. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identify at least 40 TIPs robustly associated with extreme variation in major agronomic traits or secondary metabolites and in most cases, no SNP tags the TE insertion allele. Collectively, these findings highlight the unique role of TE mobilization in tomato diversification, with important implications for breeding.},

Generating such alignments introduces references biases, in particular against insertion alleles absent in the reference and comes with substantial computational burden. In contrast, recent k-mer-based genotyping methods are fast, but struggle in repetitive or duplicated regions of the genome. We propose a novel algorithm, called PanGenie, that leverages a pangenome reference built from haplotype-resolved genome assemblies in conjunction with k-mer count information from raw, short-read sequencing data to genotype a wide spectrum of genetic variation. The given haplotypes enable our method to take advantage of linkage information to aid genotyping in regions poorly covered by unique k-mers and provides access to regions otherwise inaccessible by short reads. Compared to classic mapping-based approaches, our approach is more than 4\texttimes{} faster at 30\texttimes{} coverage and at the same time, reached significantly better genotype concordances for almost all variant types and coverages tested. Improvements are especially pronounced for large insertions ({$>$} 50bp), where we are able to genotype {$>$} 99.9\% of all tested variants with over 90\% accuracy at 30\texttimes{} short-read coverage, where the best competing tools either typed less than 60\% of variants or reached accuracies below 70\%.

  abstract = {As researchers are increasingly able to collect data on a large scale from multiple clinical and omics modalities, multi-omics integration is becoming a critical component of metabolomics research. This introduces a need for increased understanding by the metabolomics researcher of computational and statistical analysis methods relevant to multi-omics studies. In this review, we discuss common types of analyses performed in multi-omics studies and the computational and statistical methods that can be used for each type of analysis. We pinpoint the caveats and considerations for analysis methods, including required parameters, sample size and data distribution requirements, sources of a priori knowledge, and techniques for the evaluation of model accuracy. Finally, for the types of analyses discussed, we provide examples of the applications of corresponding methods to clinical and basic research. We intend that our review may be used as a guide for metabolomics researchers to choose effective techniques for multi-omics analyses relevant to their field of study.},

We generated a pangenome representation (the Practical Haplotype Graph, PHG) of these assemblies in a database, representing the pangenome haplotype diversity and providing an initial estimate of structural diversity. We leveraged the pangenome to accurately impute haplotypes and genotypes of taxa using various kinds of sequence data, ranging from WGS to extremely-low coverage GBS. We imputed the genotypes of the recombinant inbred lines of the NAM population with over 99\% mean accuracy, while unrelated germplasm attained a mean imputation accuracy of 92 or 95\% when using GBS or WGS data, respectively. Most of the imputation errors occur in haplotypes within European or tropical germplasm, which have yet to be represented in the maize PHG database. Also, the PHG stores the imputation data in a 30,000-fold more spaceefficient manner than a standard genotype file, which is a key improvement when dealing with large scale data.},

  abstract = {Microbial pan-genomes are shaped by a complex combination of stochastic and deterministic forces. Even closely related genomes often exhibit extensive variation in their gene content. Understanding what drives this variation requires exploring the interactions of genes with each other and with their external environments. However, to date, conceptual models of pan-genome dynamics often represent genes as independent units and provide limited information about their mechanistic interactions. Here, we use pan-reactomes as proxies for pan-genomes since they can explicitly represent the interactions between the genes that code for metabolic reactions and simulate complex phenotypes that interact with the metabolic environment. We interpreted pan-reactomes as a dynamic pool of metabolic reactions that are potentially gained or lost and simulated the routes along which different lineages lose reactions in alternative environments. We performed these simulations on the pan-reactomes of 46 bacterial and archaeal families covering a broad taxonomic range. These simulations allowed us to disentangle metabolic reactions whose presence does, and does not depend on the metabolite composition of the external environment, allowing us to identify reactions are constrained ``by nutrition'' and ``by nature'', respectively. By comparing the frequency of reactions from the first group with their observed frequencies in bacterial and archaeal families, we predicted the metabolic niches that shaped the genomic composition of these lineages in their evolutionary past. Moreover, we found that the lineages that were shaped by a more diverse metabolic niche also occur in more diverse biomes. A prediction confirmed by comparison with of over twenty-two thousand environmental sequencing datasets samples that span 140 diverse global biomes. Together, we introduce a computational framework for analyzing and interpreting pan-reactomes that provides new insights into the ecological and evolutionary drivers of pan-genome composition.},

These methods usually lack multivariate statistical models to infer the partitions and the optimal number of classes and don't account for genome organization. We introduce a graph structure to model pangenomes in which nodes represent gene families and edges represent genomic neighborhood. Our method, named PPanGGOLiN, partitions nodes using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on multivariate Bernoulli Mixture Model coupled with a Markov Random Field. This approach takes into account the topology of the graph and the presence/absence of genes in pangenomes to classify gene families into persistent, cloud, and one or several shell partitions. By analyzing the partitioned pangenome graphs of isolate genomes from 439 species and metagenome-assembled genomes from 78 species, we demonstrate that our method is effective in estimating the persistent genome. Interestingly, it shows that the shell genome is a key element to understand genome dynamics, presumably because it reflects how genes present at intermediate frequencies drive adaptation of species, and its proportion in genomes is independent of genome size. The graph-based approach proposed by PPanGGOLiN is useful to depict the overall genomic diversity of thousands of strains in a compact structure and provides an effective basis for very large scale comparative genomics.

Such polymorphic Alus are powerful markers to understand population structure, and they represent variants that can greatly impact genome function, including gene expression. Accurate genotyping of Alus and other mobile elements has been challenging. Indeed, we found that Alu genotypes previously called for the 1000 Genomes Project are sometimes erroneous, which poses significant problems for phasing these insertions with other variants that comprise the haplotype. To ameliorate this issue, we introduce a new pipeline \textendash{} TypeTE \textendash{} which genotypes Alu insertions from whole-genome sequencing data. Starting from a list of polymorphic Alus, TypeTE identifies the hallmarks (poly-A tail and target site duplication) and orientation of Alu insertions using local re-assembly to reconstruct presence and absence alleles. Genotype likelihoods are then computed after re-mapping sequencing reads to the reconstructed alleles. Using a high-quality set of PCR-based genotyping of {$>$}200 loci, we show that TypeTE improves genotype accuracy from 83\% to 92\% in the 1000 Genomes dataset. TypeTE can be readily adapted to other retrotransposon families and brings a valuable toolbox addition for population genomics.},

The use of graphs to model biological aspects in computational biology, in bioinformatics and biomedicine is currently growing. Graphs enable researchers to easily model relations among objects. Currently in bioinformatics and systems biology there is a growing interest in the analysis of associations among biological molecules at a network level. A main topic of research in this area is represented by the inference and analysis of biological networks from experimental data. Often researchers aim to analyze differences of evolutions among different networks, i.e., networks representing different states of the same reality or networks coming from different species. Consequently, a wide variety of algorithms have been developed to analyze and compare networks. In particular, the comparison of networks is often performed through network alignment algorithms that rely on graph and subgraph isomorphisms. Biological Network Analysis considers three major biological networks, including Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN), Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPIN), and Human Brain Connectomes.

  abstract = {Difficulty in detecting rare variants is one of the problems in conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The problem is closely related to the complex gene compositions comprising multiple alleles, such as haplotypes. Several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. These methods, however, have been rarely discussed in connection with haplotypes. In this study, we developed a novel SNP-set method named ``RAINBOW'' and applied the method to haplotypebased GWAS by regarding a haplotype block as a SNP-set. Combining haplotype block estimation and SNP-set GWAS, haplotype-based GWAS can be conducted without prior information of haplotypes. We prepared 100 datasets of simulated phenotypic data and real marker genotype data of Oryza sativa subsp. indica, and performed GWAS of the datasets. We compared the power of our method, the conventional single-SNP GWAS, the conventional haplotype-based GWAS, and the conventional SNP-set GWAS. Our proposed method was shown to be superior to these in three aspects: (1) controlling false positives; (2) in detecting causal variants without relying on the linkage disequilibrium if causal variants were genotyped in the dataset; and (3) it showed greater power than the other methods, i.e., it was able to detect causal variants that were not detected by the others, primarily when the causal variants were located very close to each other, and the directions of their effects were opposite. By using the SNP-set approach as in this study, we expect that detecting not only rare variants but also genes with complex mechanisms, such as genes with multiple causal variants, can be realized.

  abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster, a small dipteran of African origin, represents one of the best-studied model organisms. Early work in this system has uniquely shed light on the basic principles of genetics and resulted in a versatile collection of genetic tools that allow to uncover mechanistic links between genotype and phenotype. Moreover, given its world-wide distribution in diverse habitats and its moderate genome-size, Drosophila has proven very powerful for population genetics inference and was one of the first eukaryotes whose genome was fully sequenced. In this bookchapter, we provide a brief historical overview of research in Drosophila and then focus on recent advances during the genomic era. After describing different types and sources of genomic data, we discuss mechanisms of neutral evolution including the demographic history of Drosophila and the effects of recombination and biased gene conversion. Then, we review recent advances in detecting genome-wide signals of selection, such as soft and hard selective sweeps. We further provide a brief introduction to background selection, selection of non-coding DNA and codon usage and focus on the role of structural variants, such as transposable elements and chromosomal inversions, during the adaptive process. Finally, we discuss how genomic data helps to dissect neutral and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms that shape genetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations along environmental gradients. In summary, this book chapter serves as a starting point to Drosophila population genomics and provides an introduction to the system and an overview to data sources, important population genetic concepts and recent advances in the field.},

SNP-heritability is proportional to the product of these quantities. We present a basic model, using detailed linkage disequilibrium structure from a reference panel of 11 million SNPs, to estimate these quantities from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities (as a fraction of the reference panel) ranging from ' 2 \texttimes{} 10-5 to ' 4 \texttimes{} 10-3, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs reaching genome-wide significance at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability. The model also allows for estimating residual inflation (or deflation from over-correcting of z-scores), and assessing compatibility of replication and discovery GWAS summary statistics.

By entering homologous sequences, PoSeiDon builds an alignment, estimates a best-fitting substitution model, and performs a recombination analysis followed by the construction of all corresponding phylogenies. Finally, significantly positive selected sites are detected according to different models for the full alignment and possible recombination fragments. The results of PoSeiDon are summarized in a user-friendly HTML page providing all intermediate results and the graphical representation of recombination events and positively selected sites.

  abstract = {Background: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other. Results: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plateand droplet-based single-cell platforms. Conclusions: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.},

  abstract = {Background: Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), which seek the association between epigenetic marks and an outcome or exposure, involve multiple hypothesis testing. False discovery rate (FDR) control has been widely used for multiple testing correction. However, traditional FDR control methods do not use auxiliary covariates, and they could be less powerful if the covariates could inform the likelihood of the null hypothesis. Recently, many covariate-adaptive FDR control methods have been developed, but application of these methods to EWAS data has not yet been explored. It is not clear whether these methods can significantly improve detection power, and if so, which covariates are more relevant for EWAS data. Results: In this study, we evaluate the performance of five covariate-adaptive FDR control methods with EWASrelated covariates using simulated as well as real EWAS datasets. We develop an omnibus test to assess the informativeness of the covariates. We find that statistical covariates are generally more informative than biological covariates, and the covariates of methylation mean and variance are almost universally informative. In contrast, the informativeness of biological covariates depends on specific datasets. We show that the independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) and covariate adaptive multiple testing (CAMT) method are overall more powerful, especially for sparse signals, and could improve the detection power by a median of 25\% and 68\% on real datasets, compared to the ST procedure. We further validate the findings in various biological contexts. Conclusions: Covariate-adaptive FDR control methods with informative covariates can significantly increase the detection power for EWAS. For sparse signals, IHW and CAMT are recommended.},

We discuss different ways that the approach has been built upon to accommodate multiple causal variants in a region and to incorporate additional layers of functional annotation data. We further review methods for simultaneous fine-mapping of multiple datasets, either exploiting different linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures across ancestries or borrowing information between distinct but related traits. Finally, we look to the future and the opportunities that will be offered by increasingly accurate maps of causal variants for a multitude of human traits.},

Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data can answer targeted biological questions regarding the expression of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, independently, but a systematic multi-omics integration (MOI) can comprehensively assimilate, annotate, and model these large data sets. Previous MOI studies and reviews have detailed its usage and practicality on various organisms including human, animals, microbes, and plants. Plants are especially challenging due to large poorly annotated genomes, multi-organelles, and diverse secondary metabolites. Hence, constructive and methodological guidelines on how to perform MOI for plants are needed, particularly for researchers newly embarking on this topic. In this review, we thoroughly classify multi-omics studies on plants and verify workflows to ensure successful omics integration with accurate data representation. We also propose three levels of MOI, namely element-based (level 1), pathway-based (level 2), and mathematical-based integration (level 3). These MOI levels are described in relation to recent publications and tools, to highlight their practicality and function. The drawbacks and limitations of these MOI are also discussed for future improvement toward more amenable strategies in plant systems biology.},

  abstract = {Availability of genome sequence of different legume species has provided an opportunity to characterize the abundance, distribution, and divergence of canonical intact long terminal retrotransposons (In-LTR-RT) superfamilies. Among seven legume species, Arachis ipaensis (Aip) showed the highest number of full-length canonical In-LTR-RTs (3325), followed by Glycine max (Gma, 2328), Vigna angularis (Van, 1625), Arachis durensis (Adu, 1348), Lotus japonicus (Lja, 1294), Medicago truncatula (Mtr, 788), and Circer arietinum (Car, 124). Divergence time analysis demonstrated that the amplification timeframe of LTR-RTs dramatically varied in different families. The average insertion time of Copia element varied from 0.51 (Van) to 1.37 million years ago (Mya) (Adu, and Aip), whereas that of Gypsy was between 0.22 (Mtr) and 1.82 Mya (Adu). Bayesian phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that the 1397 and 1917 reverse transcriptase (RT) domains of Copia and Gypsy families of the seven legume species were clustered into 7 and 14 major groups, respectively. The highest proportion (approximately 94.79\textendash 100\%) of transposable element (TE)-associated genes assigned to pathways was mapped to metabolism-related pathways in all species. The results enabled the structural understanding of full-length In-LTR-RTs and will be valuable resource for the further study of the impact of TEs on gene structure and expression in legume species.},

In deep sequence datasets of {$>$}10,000 samples, \textasciitilde 10\% of the variant sites are observed to be multi-allelic. Many of the multi-allelic variants have been shown to be functional and disease-relevant. Proper analysis of multi-allelic variants is critical to the success of a sequencing study, but existing methods do not properly handle multi-allelic variants and can produce highly misleading association results. We discuss practical issues and methods to encode multi-allelic sites, conduct single-variant and gene-level association analyses, and perform meta-analysis for multi-allelic variants. We evaluated these methods through extensive simulations and the study of a large meta-analysis of \textasciitilde 18,000 samples on the cigarettes-per-day phenotype. We showed that our joint modeling approach provided an unbiased estimate of genetic effects, greatly improved the power of single-variant association tests among methods that can properly estimate allele effects, and enhanced gene-level tests over existing approaches. Software packages implementing these methods are available online.},

We present MetaGraph, a versatile framework for the scalable analysis of extensive sequence repositories. MetaGraph efficiently indexes vast collections of sequences to enable fast search and comprehensive analysis. A wide range of underlying data structures offer different practically relevant trade-offs between the space taken by the index and its query performance. MetaGraph provides a flexible methodological framework allowing for index construction to be scaled from consumer laptops to distribution onto a cloud compute cluster for processing terabases to petabases of input data. Achieving compression ratios of up to 1,000-fold over the already compressed raw input data, MetaGraph can represent the content of large sequencing archives in the working memory of a single compute server. We demonstrate our framework's scalability by indexing over 1.4 million whole genome sequencing (WGS) records from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive, representing a total input of more than three petabases.},

We apply the MAC to a dataset of 1595 drug-tested               Mycobacterium tuberculosis               strains and show that MACs predict AMR phenotypes with accuracy on par with mechanism-agnostic machine learning models (isoniazid AUC\,=\,0.93) while enabling a biochemical interpretation of the genotype-phenotype map. Interpretation of MACs for three antibiotics (pyrazinamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid) recapitulates known AMR mechanisms and suggest a biochemical basis for how the identified alleles cause AMR. Extending flux balance analysis to identify accurate sequence classifiers thus contributes mechanistic insights to GWAS, a field thus far dominated by mechanism-agnostic results.},

In this study, we discovered SVs across a population sample of 347 highcoverage, resequenced genomes of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild ancestor (O. rufipogon). In addition to this shortread data set, we also inferred SVs from whole-genome assemblies and long-read data. Comparisons among data sets revealed different features of genome variability. For example, genome alignment identified a large (\$4.3 Mb) inversion in indica rice varieties relative to japonica varieties, and long-read analyses suggest that \$9\% of genes from the outgroup (O. longistaminata) are hemizygous. We focused, however, on the resequencing sample to investigate the population genomics of SVs. Clustering analyses with SVs recapitulated the rice cultivar groups that were also inferred from SNPs. However, the site-frequency spectrum of each SV type\textemdash which included inversions, duplications, deletions, translocations, and mobile element insertions\textemdash was skewed toward lower frequency variants than synonymous SNPs, suggesting that SVs may be predominantly deleterious. Among transposable elements, SINE and mariner insertions were found at especially low frequency. We also used SVs to study domestication by contrasting between rice and O. rufipogon. Cultivated genomes contained \$25\% more derived SVs and mobile element insertions than O. rufipogon, indicating that SVs contribute to the cost of domestication in rice. Peaks of SV divergence were enriched for known domestication genes, but we also detected hundreds of genes gained and lost during domestication, some of which were enriched for traits of agronomic interest.},

Using these assembled genomes together with three previously reported genomes, we constructed a graph-based genome and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified numerous genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto a single reference genome. The structural variations from the 2,898 accessions that were genotyped based on the graph-based genome and the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the representative 26 accessions helped to link genetic variations to candidate genes that are responsible for important traits. This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics studies in soybean.},

  abstract = {Background: During the last decade, the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) sequence has become a powerful tool for the study of past human populations. However, the degraded nature of aDNA means that aDNA molecules are short and frequently mutated by post-mortem chemical modifications. These features decrease read mapping accuracy and increase reference bias, in which reads containing non-reference alleles are less likely to be mapped than those containing reference alleles. Alternative approaches have been developed to replace the linear reference with a variation graph which includes known alternative variants at each genetic locus. Here, we evaluate the use of variation graph software vg to avoid reference bias for aDNA and compare with existing methods. Results: We use vg to align simulated and real aDNA samples to a variation graph containing 1000 Genome Project variants and compare with the same data aligned with bwa to the human linear reference genome. Using vg leads to a balanced allelic representation at polymorphic sites, effectively removing reference bias, and more sensitive variant detection in comparison with bwa, especially for insertions and deletions (indels). Alternative approaches that use relaxed bwa parameter settings or filter bwa alignments can also reduce bias but can have lower sensitivity than vg, particularly for indels. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that aligning aDNA sequences to variation graphs effectively mitigates the impact of reference bias when analyzing aDNA, while retaining mapping sensitivity and allowing detection of variation, in particular indel variation, that was previously missed.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             The concept of trade-offs permeates our thinking about adaptive evolution because they are exhibited at every level of biological organization, from molecular and cellular processes to organismal and ecological functions. Trade-offs inevitably arise because different traits do not occur in isolation, but instead are imbedded within complex, integrated systems that make up whole organisms. The genetic and mechanistic underpinning of trade-offs can be found in the pleiotropic nodes that occur in the biological pathways shared between traits. Yet, often trade-offs are only understood as statistical correlations, limiting the ability to evaluate the interplay between how selection and constraint interact during adaptive evolution. Here, we first review the classic paradigms in which physiologists and evolutionary biologists have studied trade-offs and highlight the ways in which network and molecular pathway approaches unify these paradigms. We discuss how these approaches allow researchers to evaluate why trade-offs arise and how selection can act to overcome trait correlations and evolutionary constraints. We argue that understanding how the conserved molecular pathways are shared between different traits and functions provides a conceptual framework for evolutionary biologists, physiologists, and molecular biologists to meaningfully work together toward the goal of understanding why correlations and trade-offs occur between traits. We briefly highlight the melanocortin system and the hormonal control of osmoregulation as two case studies where an understanding of shared molecular pathways reveals why trade-offs occur between seemingly unrelated traits. While we recognize that applying such approaches poses challenges and limitations particularly in the context of natural populations, we advocate for the view that focusing on the biological pathways responsible for trade-offs provides a unified conceptual context accessible to a broad range of integrative biologists.},

Both ERCC1-XPF and MSH2-MSH3 bind to Z-DNA-forming sequences, though ERCC1-XPF recruitment to Z-DNA is dependent on MSH2-MSH3. Moreover, ERCC1-XPF               -               dependent DNA strand-breaks occur near the Z-DNA-forming region in human cell extracts, and we model these interactions at the sub-molecular level.

Several novel complexes are involved in vernalization and pathogen defense, traits critical for agriculture.

We present an algorithm, SibeliaZ-LCB, for identifying collinear blocks in closely related genomes based on analysis of the de Bruijn graph. We further incorporate this into a multiple whole-genome alignment pipeline called SibeliaZ. SibeliaZ shows run-time improvements over other methods while maintaining accuracy. On sixteen recently-assembled strains of mice, SibeliaZ runs in under 16 hours on a single machine, while other tools did not run to completion for eight mice within a week. SibeliaZ makes a significant step towards improving scalability of multiple whole-genome alignment and collinear block reconstruction algorithms on a single machine.},

  abstract = {Background: Advances in sequencing technologies have led to the release of reference genomes and annotations for multiple individuals within more well-studied systems. While each of these new genome assemblies shares significant portions of synteny between each other, the annotated structure of gene models within these regions can differ. Of particular concern are split-gene misannotations, in which a single gene is incorrectly annotated as two distinct genes or two genes are incorrectly annotated as a single gene. These misannotations can have major impacts on functional prediction, estimates of expression, and many downstream analyses. Results: We developed a high-throughput method based on pairwise comparisons of annotations that detect potential split-gene misannotations and quantifies support for whether the genes should be merged into a single gene model. We demonstrated the utility of our method using gene annotations of three reference genomes from maize (B73, PH207, and W22), a difficult system from an annotation perspective due to the size and complexity of the genome. On average, we found several hundred of these potential split-gene misannotations in each pairwise comparison, corresponding to 3\textendash 5\% of gene models across annotations. To determine which state (i.e. one gene or multiple genes) is biologically supported, we utilized RNAseq data from 10 tissues throughout development along with a novel metric and simulation framework. The methods we have developed require minimal human interaction and can be applied to future assemblies to aid in annotation efforts. Conclusions: Split-gene misannotations occur at appreciable frequency in maize annotations. We have developed a method to easily identify and correct these misannotations. Importantly, this method is generic in that it can utilize any type of short-read expression data. Failure to account for split-gene misannotations has serious consequences for biological inference, particularly for expression-based analyses.},

However, when two genes overlap the same nucleotide sites in different frames, synonymous changes in one gene may be nonsynonymous in the other, perturbing dN/dS. Thus, scalable methods are needed to estimate functional constraint specifically for overlapping genes (OLGs). We propose OLGenie, which implements a modification of the Wei\textendash Zhang method. Assessment with simulations and controls from viral genomes (58 OLGs and 176 non-OLGs) demonstrates low false-positive rates and good discriminatory ability in differentiating true OLGs from non-OLGs. We also apply OLGenie to the unresolved case of HIV-1's putative antisense protein gene, showing significant purifying selection. OLGenie can be used to study known OLGs and to predict new OLGs in genome annotation.

  abstract = {Abstract           Transposable elements (TEs) have the potential to create regulatory variation both through disruption of existing DNA regulatory elements and through creation of novel DNA regulatory elements. In a species with a large genome, such as maize, the many TEs interspersed with genes creates opportunities for significant allelic variation due to TE presence/absence polymorphisms among individuals. We used information on putative regulatory elements in combination with knowledge about TE polymorphisms in maize to identify TE insertions that interrupt existing accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) in B73 as well as examples of polymorphic TEs that contain ACRs among four inbred lines of maize including B73, Mo17, W22, and PH207. The TE insertions in three other assembled maize genomes (Mo17, W22 or PH207) that interrupt ACRs that are present in the B73 genome can trigger changes to the chromatin suggesting the potential for both genetic and epigenetic influences of these insertions. Nearly 20\% of the ACRs located over 2kb from the nearest gene are located within an annotated TE. These are regions of unmethylated DNA that show evidence for functional importance similar to ACRs that are not present within TEs. Using a large panel of maize genotypes we tested if there is an association between the presence of TE insertions that interrupt, or carry, an ACR and the expression of nearby genes. TEs that carry ACRs exhibit an enrichment for being associated with higher expression of nearby genes, suggesting that these TEs may create novel regulatory elements. These analyses highlight the potential for TEs to rewire transcriptional responses in eukaryotic genomes.                        Data Availability             In this study we utilize previously published datasets that are available through the following accessions: SRX4727413, SRR8738272, and SRR8740852.},

  abstract = {Around ten thousand years ago, men mostly relied on hunting and gathering activities before shifting to agriculture and allied practices. By 4000 years ago, ancient people had completed the domestication of all major crop species upon which human survival is dependent, including rice, wheat, and maize. Recent advances have started to point out the genes that were responsible for this change of the cultivated maize crop. The list of genes to date tentatively suggests that diverse plant developmental pathways were the targets of Neolithic ``genetic tinkering,'' Maize and its closest wild relatives, the teosintes, present a paradox. Even though maize and the teosintes exhibit extreme differences in their adult morphologies their genomes are so similar that they share the same chromosome number, similar or identical chromosome morphologies, and they can be easily cross-hybridized. A very high level of diversity exists among the maize landraces to explain this diversity many workers have proposed that maize landraces were the products of multiple independent domestication from their wild relative. Reports indicate that all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. This phylogenetic work is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize was the result of early Holocene domesticates. A few major genes or multiple linked minor genes on the maize chromosome largely govern the drastic change that is seen between teosinte and maize. Genes like teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene, teosinte glume architecture1 (tga1) and Zea Floricaula / Leafy2 (zfl2). There still remain some untold chapters in the origin and early diversification of maize. These questions will require additional archaeological and botanical exploration, more powerful molecular analyses, and perhaps DNA analysis of archaeological materials such that a perfect phylogenetic relationship can be established.},

We present the first comparative analysis integrating TE expression and TE regulatory pathway activity in somatic and gametic tissues for a diverse set of 12 vertebrates. We conduct simultaneous gene and TE expression analyses to characterize patterns of TE expression and TE regulation across vertebrates and examine relationships between these features. We find remarkable variation in the expression of genes involved in TE negative regulation across tissues and species, yet consistently high expression in germline tissues, particularly in testes. Most vertebrates show comparably high levels of TE regulatory pathway activity across gonadal tissues except for mammals, where reduced activity of TE regulatory pathways in ovarian tissues may be the result of lower relative germ cell densities. We also find that all vertebrate lineages examined exhibit remarkably high levels of TE-derived transcripts in somatic and gametic tissues, with recently active TE families showing higher expression in gametic tissues. Although most TE-derived transcripts originate from inactive ancient TE families (and are likely incapable of transposition), such high levels of TE-derived RNA in the cytoplasm may have secondary, unappreciated biological relevance.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are highly genetically correlated, and many studies have focused on their shared genetic components. However, little research has been conducted on the genetic differences between psychiatric disorders, because case-case comparisons currently require individual-level data from cases of both disorders. We developed a new method (CC-GWAS) to test for differences in allele frequency among cases of two different disorders using summary statistics from the respective casecontrol GWAS; CC-GWAS relies on analytical assessments of the genetic distance between cases and controls of each disorder. Simulations and analytical computations confirm that CC-GWAS is wellpowered and attains effective control of type I error. We applied CC-GWAS to publicly available summary statistics for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, and identified 116 independent genome-wide significant loci distinguishing these three disorders, including 21 CCGWAS-specific loci that were not genome-wide significant in the input case-control summary statistics. Two of the CC-GWAS-specific loci implicate the genes KLF6 and KLF16 from the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors; these genes have been linked to neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration. We performed a broader set of case-case comparisons by additionally analyzing ADHD, anorexia nervosa, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette's Syndrome, yielding a total of 200 independent loci distinguishing eight psychiatric disorders, including 74 CC-GWAS-specific loci. We confirmed that loci identified by CC-GWAS replicated convincingly in applications to data sets for which independent replication data were available. In conclusion, CC-GWAS robustly identifies loci with different allele frequencies among cases of different disorders using results from the respective case-control GWAS, providing new insights into the genetic differences between eight psychiatric disorders.},

Weedy rice is a feral form of rice that infests paddies worldwide and aggressively outcompetes cultivated varieties. Despite increasing attention in recent years, a comprehensive understanding of the origins of weedy crop relatives and how a universal feralization process acts at the genomic and molecular level to allow the rapid adaptation to weediness are still yet to be explored. Results: We use whole-genome sequencing to examine the origin and adaptation of 524 global weedy rice samples representing all major regions of rice cultivation. Weed populations have evolved multiple times from cultivated rice, and a strikingly high proportion of contemporary Asian weed strains can be traced to a few Green Revolution cultivars that were widely grown in the late twentieth century. Latin American weedy rice stands out in having originated through extensive hybridization. Selection scans indicate that most genomic regions underlying weedy adaptations do not overlap with domestication targets of selection, suggesting that feralization occurs largely through changes at loci unrelated to domestication. Conclusions: This is the first investigation to provide detailed genomic characterizations of weedy rice on a global scale, and the results reveal diverse genetic mechanisms underlying worldwide convergent rice feralization.},

Although TEs comprise the majority of the maize genome and affect important phenotypes, genome wide patterns of TE polymorphisms in maize have only been studied in a handful of maize genotypes, due in part to the challenging nature of assessing highly repetitive sequences. We implemented a method to use short read sequencing data from 509 diverse inbred lines to classify the presence/absence of 494,564 non-redundant TEs that were previously annotated in four genome assemblies including B73, Mo17, PH207, and W22. Different orders of TEs (i.e. LTRs, Helitrons, TIRs) had different frequency distributions within the population. Across the different orders, TE family size was negatively correlated with average population frequency of TEs in the family and nested TEs are at lower frequency than non-nested TEs. Age of LTR elements was positively correlated with population frequency. Comparison with SNP data revealed that while a majority of TEs are tagged by nearby SNPs (r2 {$>$} 0.9) there are also many TEs in low to moderate linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs. This study provides a population scale genome-wide assessment of TE variation in maize, and provides valuable insight on variation in TEs in maize and factors that contribute to this variation.},

At the same time, the conventional approach of mapping sequencing reads against a single reference genome sequence is no longer adequate. However, even where multiple high-quality reference genomes are available, the problem remains how one would integrate results from pairwise analyses.                                   Result                            To overcome the limits imposed by mapping sequence reads against a single reference genome, or serially mapping them against multiple reference genomes, we have developed the               MGR               method that allows simultaneous comparison against multiple high-quality reference genomes, in order to remove the bias that comes from using only a single-genome reference and to simplify downstream analyses. To this end, we present the               MGR               algorithm that creates a graph (               MGR               graph) as a               multi-genome               reference.

To evaluate the performance of our model, we have developed a genome compression tool, which can be used to estimate the amount of shared information between genomes.

Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.},

Integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets in general, and clustering of samples in such datasets specifically, can improve our understanding of biological processes and discover different disease subtypes. In this work we present MONET (Multi Omic clustering by Non-Exhaustive Types), which presents a unique approach to multi-omic clustering. MONET discovers modules of similar samples, such that each module is allowed to have a clustering structure for only a subset of the omics. This approach differs from most existent multi-omic clustering algorithms, which assume a common structure across all omics, and from several recent algorithms that model distinct cluster structures. We tested MONET extensively on simulated data, on an image dataset, and on ten multi-omic cancer datasets from TCGA. Our analysis shows that MONET compares favorably with other multi-omic clustering methods. We demonstrate MONET's biological and clinical relevance by analyzing its results for Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma. We also show that MONET is robust to missing data, can cluster genes in multi-omic dataset, and reveal modules of cell types in single-cell multi-omic data. Our work shows that MONET is a valuable tool that can provide complementary results to those provided by existent algorithms for multi-omic analysis.},

  abstract = {Genetic sources of phenotypic variation have been a focus of plant studies aimed at improving agricultural yield and understanding adaptive processes. Genome-wide association studies identify the genetic background behind a trait by examining associations between phenotypes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although such studies are common, biological interpretation of the results remains a challenge; especially due to the confounding nature of population structure and the systematic biases thus introduced. Here, we propose a complementary analysis (SNPeffect) that offers putative genotype-to-phenotype mechanistic interpretations by integrating biochemical knowledge encoded in metabolic models. SNPeffect is used to explain differential growth rate and metabolite accumulation in A. thaliana and P. trichocarpa accessions as the outcome of SNPs in enzyme-coding genes. To this end, we also constructed a genome-scale metabolic model for Populus trichocarpa, the first for a perennial woody tree. As expected, our results indicate that growth is a complex polygenic trait governed by carbon and energy partitioning. The predicted set of functional SNPs in both species are associated with experimentally characterized growth-determining genes and also suggest putative ones. Functional SNPs were found in pathways such as amino acid metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, and cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, in line with breeding strategies that target pathways governing carbon and energy partition.},

This package facilitates improved reproducibility and interpretability of bGWAS results. prewas enables users to extract maximal information from bGWAS by implementing multi-l\-ine representation for multiallelic sites and variants in overlapping genes. prewas outputs a binary SNP matrix that can be used for SNP-b\- ased bGWAS and will prevent the masking of minor alleles during bGWAS analysis. The optional binary gene matrix output can be used for gene-\-based bGWAS, which will enable users to maximize the power and evolutionary interpretability of their bGWAS studies. prewas is available for download from GitHub.},

Instead, we rely on well-established genetic models of linkage disequilibrium. We demonstrate that our method can detect more associations than mixed effects models and achieve fine-mapping precision, at comparable computational cost. Lastly, we apply               KnockoffZoom               to data from 350k subjects in the UK Biobank and report many new findings.},

Recent evidence showed that i-motif structures in human cells play regulatory roles in the genome. Therefore, characterization of novel i-motifs and investigation of their functional implication are urgently needed for comprehensive understanding of their roles in gene regulation. However, considering the complications of experimental investigation of i-motifs and the large number of putative i-motifs in the genome, development of an in silico tool for the characterization of i-motifs in the high throughput scale is necessary. We developed a novel computation method, MD-TSPC4, to predict the thermal stability of i-motifs based on molecular modeling and molecular dynamic simulation. By assuming that the flexibility of loops in i-motifs correlated with thermal stability within certain temperature ranges, we evaluated the correlation between the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of model structures and the thermal stability as the experimentally obtained melting temperature (Tm). Based on this correlation, we propose an equation for Tm prediction from RMSD. We expect this method can be useful for estimating the overall structure and stability of putative i-motifs in the genome, which can be a starting point of further structural and functional studies of i-motifs.},

We proposed an analysis pipeline to understand metabolism under specific conditions based on a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM). Context-specific GEMs under drought and well-watered control conditions were reconstructed using transcriptome data and examined using metabolome data. The metabolic fluxes throughout the metabolic network were estimated by flux balance analysis using the context-specific GEMs. We used in silico methods to identify an important reaction contributing to biomass production and clarified metabolic reaction responses under drought stress by comparative analysis between drought and control conditions.

Despite broadly similar phenotypes, they have tremendous genomic diversity with a broad range of ploidy levels and transposons. These features make Andropogoneae a powerful system for studying conserved non-coding sequence (CNS), here we used it to understand the function of CNS in maize. We find that 86\% of CNS comprise known genomic elements e.g.,             cis             -regulatory elements, chromosome interactions, introns, several transposable element superfamilies, and are linked to genomic regions related to DNA replication initiation, DNA methylation and histone modification. In maize, we show that CNSs regulate gene expression and variants in CNS are associated with phenotypic variance, and rare CNS absence contributes to loss of gene expression. Furthermore, we find the evolution of CNS is associated with the functional diversification of duplicated genes in the context of the maize subgenomes. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of constrained non-coding elements and identify functional non-coding variation in maize.},

As an advanced computational approach, machine learning, which enables people to identify complex patterns and insight from data, has consequently been harnessed to analyze and interpret large, highly complex genetic and transcriptomic data toward a better understanding of PD. In particular, machine learning models have been developed to integrate patient genotype data alone or combined with demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and other information, for PD outcome study. They have also been used to identify biomarkers of PD based on transcriptomic data, e.g., gene expression profiles from microarrays. This study overviews the relevant literature on using machine learning models for genetic and transcriptomic data analysis in PD, points out remaining challenges, and suggests future directions accordingly. Undoubtedly, the use of machine learning is amplifying PD genetic and transcriptomic achievements for accelerating the study of PD. Existing studies have demonstrated the great potential of machine learning in discovering hidden patterns within genetic or transcriptomic information and thus revealing clues underpinning pathology and pathogenesis. Moving forward, by addressing the remaining challenges, machine learning may advance our ability to precisely diagnose, prognose, and treat PD.},

Different pathogenic mechanisms may underlie these non-coding repeat expansion disorders. While gain-of-function mechanisms, such as toxicity associated with expression of repeat RNA or toxicity associated with repeatassociated non-ATG (RAN) products, are most frequently connected with these disorders, loss-of-function mechanisms have also been implicated. We review the different pathways that have been linked to non-coding repeat expansion disorders such as C9ORF72linked ALS/frontotemporal dementia (FTD), myotonic dystrophy, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), SCA, and Huntington's disease-like 2. We discuss modes of RNA toxicity focusing on the identity and the interacting partners of the toxic RNA species. Using the C9ORF72 ALS/FTD paradigm, we further explore the efforts and different methods used to disentangle RNA vs. RAN toxicity. Overall, we conclude that there is ample evidence for a role of RNA toxicity in non-coding repeat expansion diseases.},

Here we perform a comprehensive multi-omics analysis (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics) of 300 MIBC patients treated with chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or first-line) to identify molecular changes associated with treatment response. DNA-based associations with response converge on genomic instability driven by a high number of chromosomal alterations, indels, signature 5 mutations and/or               BRCA2               mutations. Expression data identifies the basal/squamous gene expression subtype to be associated with poor response. Immune cell infiltration and high PD-1 protein expression are associated with treatment response. Through integration of genomic and transcriptomic data, we demonstrate patient stratification to groups of low and high likelihood of cisplatin-based response. This could pave the way for future patient selection following validation in prospective clinical trials.},

Specialised boundary cells form at segment borders that act as a source or regulator of neuronal differentiation. In zebrafish, there is spatial patterning of neurogenesis in which non-neurogenic zones form at boundaries and segment centres, in part mediated by Fgf20 signalling. To further understand the control of neurogenesis, we have carried out single cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish hindbrain at three different stages of patterning. Analyses of the data reveal known and novel markers of distinct hindbrain segments, of cell types along the dorsoventral axis, and of the transition of progenitors to neuronal differentiation. We find major shifts in the transcriptome of progenitors and of differentiating cells between the different stages analysed. Supervised clustering with markers of boundary cells and segment centres, together with RNA-seq analysis of Fgf-regulated genes, has revealed new candidate regulators of cell differentiation in the hindbrain. These data provide a valuable resource for functional investigations of the patterning of neurogenesis and the transition of progenitors to neuronal differentiation.},

In normoxia, they use ubiquinone (UQ), but in anaerobic conditions inside the host, they require rhodoquinone (RQ) and greatly increase RQ levels. We previously showed the switch from UQ to RQ synthesis is driven by a change of substrates by the polyprenyltransferase COQ-2 (Del Borrello et al., 2019; Roberts Buceta et al., 2019); however, the mechanism of substrate selection is not known. Here, we show helminths synthesize two coq-2 splice forms, coq-2a and coq-2e, and the coq-2e-specific exon is only found in species that synthesize RQ. We show that in Caenorhabditis elegans COQ-2e is required for efficient RQ synthesis and survival in cyanide. Importantly, parasites switch from COQ-2a to COQ-2e as they transit into anaerobic environments. We conclude helminths switch from UQ to RQ synthesis principally via changes in the alternative splicing of coq-2.},

The resulting network covers 77\% of the expressed genes, and shows a scale-free topology and functional modularity like a real-world network. TF binding sequence preferences are conserved within family, while co-binding could be key for their binding specificity. Cross-species comparison shows that core network nodes at the top of the transmission of information being more conserved than those at the bottom.

However, big data demands a whole new plethora of skills in data processing, before clinically useful information can be extracted.

Results:\hspace{0.6em} The high accuracy results from integrating algorithms with stability-selection, elastic-net, and parameter optimization. Tested by a known biological network, FINET infers interactions with over 94\% precision. The high speed comes from partnering parallel computations implemented with Julia, a new compiled language that runs much faster than existing languages used in the current software, such as R, Python, and MATLAB. Regardless of FINET's implementations with Julia, users with no background in the language or computer science can easily operate it, with only a user-friendly single command line. In addition, FINET can infer other networks such as chemical networks and social networks. Overall, FINET provides a confident way to efficiently and accurately infer any type of network for any scale of data.},

Science               , this issue p.               eaba5435               ; see also p.               822                        ,              A wild relative of cultivated wheat offers a gene that drives resistance to an agricultural headache.           ,                             INTRODUCTION                                Fusarium                 head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that devastates global wheat production, with losses of billions of dollars annually. Unlike foliar diseases, FHB occurs directly on wheat spikes (inflorescences). The infection lowers grain yield and also causes the grain to be contaminated by mycotoxins produced by the                 Fusarium                 pathogen, thus imposing health threats to humans and livestock. Although plant breeders have improved wheat resistance to FHB, the lack of wheat strains with stable FHB resistance has limited progress.                                                        RATIONALE                                Many genetic loci in wheat affect FHB resistance but most only have minor effects; only a few exhibit a stable major effect on resistance. Wheat relatives in the Triticeae tribe carry resistant genes to different diseases including FHB and thus can be alternative sources of FHB resistance for wheat breeding.                 Thinopyrum                 wheatgrass has been used as a source of beneficial genes transferable to wheat by distant hybridization breeding since the 1930s.                 Fhb7,                 a gene transferred from                 Thinopyrum                 to wheat, showed a stable large effect on FHB resistance. However, the lack of a                 Thinopyrum                 reference genome hampered gene cloning and marker development, delaying the use of                 Fhb7                 in wheat breeding. Here, we cloned                 Fhb7                 using a reference assembly that we generated for                 Th. elongatum                 and characterized its resistance mechanisms and evolutionary history.                                                        RESULTS                                Using sequence data from                 Th. elongatum                 , we assembled the Triticeae E reference genome with 44,474 high-confidence genes annotated. Using this reference, we genetically mapped                 Fhb7                 and located it to a 245-kb genomic region. We determined a gene encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) as                 Fhb7                 by virus-induced gene silencing and evaluated mutants and transgenic plants. We discovered that Fhb7 detoxifies pathogen-produced trichothecene toxins by conjugating a glutathione (GSH) unit onto the epoxide moieties of type A and B trichothecenes.                 Fhb7                 GST homologs are absent in the plant kingdom, but one sequence showing \textasciitilde 97\% identity with                 Fhb7                 was found in endophytic fungi of an                 Epichlo\"e                 species that establishes symbiosis with temperate grasses. This result suggests that                 Fhb7                 might have been transferred from                 Epichlo\"e                 to                 Th. elongatum                 through horizontal gene transfer. Finally, we demonstrated that                 Fhb7                 , when introgressed into diverse wheat backgrounds by distant hybridization, confers broad resistance to both FHB and crown rot without penalizing wheat yield. Our results suggest a source of                 Fusarium                 resistance for wheat improvement.                                                        CONCLUSION                                Th. elongatum                 carries biotic and abiotic resistance genes and is a useful resource for wheat breeding. The assembled                 Th. elongatum                 reference genome can aid identification and cloning of such genes for wheat improvement. Cloning of                 Fhb7                 revealed that it encodes a GST that can detoxify trichothecene toxins. Thus,                 Fhb7                 resistance differs from                 Fhb1                 resistance, which depends on a reduction of pathogen growth in spikes, although both confer durable resistance. The ability of                 Fhb7                 to detoxify multiple mycotoxins produced by various                 Fusarium                 species demonstrates its potential as a source of resistance to the various diseases for which                 Fusarium                 trichothecenes are virulence factors. The deployment of                 Fhb7                 in commercial wheat cultivars could alleviate both the food safety issue for consumers and the yield loss problem for growers. Sequence homologies between fungal and plant                 Fhb7                 suggested that horizontal gene transfer may help to shape plant genomes.                                                                                       Fhb7                     confers FHB resistance by detoxifying trichothecenes.                                                           (                     A                     )                     Fhb7                     in                     Th. elongatum                     genome likely came from an                     Epichlo\"e                     fungus through horizontal gene transfer.                     Fhb7                     drives FHB resistance when introgressed from                     Thinopyrum                     into wheat. (                     B                     )                     Fhb7                     encodes a GST that detoxifies                     Fusarium                     -produced trichothecenes                                          by conjugating GSH (blue) to the epoxy group (red).

Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene               Fhb7               by assembling the genome of               Thinopyrum elongatum               , a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding.               Fhb7               encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and confers broad resistance to               Fusarium               species by detoxifying trichothecenes through de-epoxidation.               Fhb7               GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that               Th. elongatum               has gained               Fhb7               through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an endophytic               Epichlo\"e               species.               Fhb7               introgressions in wheat confers resistance to both FHB and crown rot in diverse wheat backgrounds without yield penalty, providing a solution for               Fusarium               resistance breeding.},

  abstract = {Sequence analysis frequently requires intuitive understanding and convenient representation of motifs. Typically, motifs are represented as position weight matrices (PWMs) and visualized using sequence logos. However, in many scenarios, in order to interpret the motif information or search for motif matches, it is compact and sufficient to represent motifs by wildcard-style consensus sequences (such as [GC][AT]GATAAG[GAC]). Based on mutual information theory and Jensen-Shannon divergence, we propose a mathematical framework to minimize the information loss in converting PWMs to consensus sequences. We name this representation as sequence Motto and have implemented an efficient algorithm with flexible options for converting motif PWMs into Motto from nucleotides, amino acids, and customized characters. We show that this representation provides a simple and efficient way to identify the binding sites of 1156 common transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome. The effectiveness of the method was benchmarked by comparing sequence matches found by Motto with PWM scanning results found by FIMO. On average, our method achieves a 0.81 area under the precision-recall curve, significantly (P-value , 0.01) outperforming all existing methods, including maximal positional weight, Cavener's method, and minimal mean square error. We believe this representation provides a distilled summary of a motif, as well as the statistical justification.},

Therefore, we develop a GWAS methodology, SEM-Bayesian alphabet, which, by applying the structural equation model (SEM), can be used to incorporate causal structures into multi-trait Bayesian regression methods. SEM-Bayesian alphabet provides a more comprehensive understanding of the genotype-phenotype mapping than multi-trait GWAS by performing GWAS based on indirect, direct and overall marker effects. The superior performance of SEM-Bayesian alphabet was demonstrated by comparing its GWAS results with other similar multi-trait GWAS methods on real and simulated data.

  abstract = {Background: Short tandem repeats (STRs) are important polymorphism makers for human identification and kinship analyses in forensic science. With the continuous development of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), more laboratories have utilized this technology for forensic applications. Existing STR genotyping tools, mostly developed for whole-genome sequencing data, are not effective for MPS data. More importantly, their backward compatibility with the conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE) technology has not been evaluated and guaranteed. Results: In this study, we developed a new end-to-end pipeline called STRsearch for STR-MPS data analysis. The STRsearch can not only determine the allele by counting repeat patterns and INDELs that are actually in the STR region, but it also translates MPS results into standard STR nomenclature (numbers and letters). We evaluated the performance of STRsearch in two forensic sequencing datasets, and the concordance with CE genotypes was 75.73 and 75.75\%, increasing 12.32 and 9.05\% than the existing tool named STRScan, respectively. Additionally, we trained a base classifier using sequence properties and used it to predict the probability of correct genotyping at a given locus, resulting in the highest accuracy of 96.13\%. Conclusions: All these results demonstrated that STRsearch was a better tool to protect the backward compatibility with CE for the targeted STR profiling in MPS data.

Maintenance of silencing is then based on a combination of RdDM and RNA-independent mechanisms involving DNA methyltransferase MET1 and chromodomain DNA methyltransferases (CMTs). Involvement of RdDM, according to this model should decrease with TE age but here we show a different pattern in tomato and               Arabidopsis               . In these species the CMTs silence long terminal repeat (LTR) transposons in the distal chromatin that are younger than those affected by RdDM. To account for these findings we propose that, after establishment of primary RdDM as in the original model, there is an RNA-independent maintenance phase involving CMTs followed by secondary RdDM. This progression of epigenetic silencing in the gene-rich distal chromatin is likely to influence the transcriptome either in               cis               or in               trans               depending on whether the mechanisms are RNA-dependent or -independent.},

How cells containing mutations evolve, are maintained, and proliferate within the body has not been well characterized. Using a quantitative framework, Watson               et al.               applied population genetic theory to estimate mutation accumulation in cells in blood from sequencing data derived from nearly 50,000 healthy individuals (see the Perspective by Curtis). By evaluating how mutations differ between blood cell populations, a phenomenon known as clonal hematopoiesis, the researchers could observe how recurrent mutations can drive certain clonal lineages to high frequencies within an individual. The risk of specific mutations, some of which are associated with leukemias, rising to high frequencies may therefore be a function of cellular selection and the age at which the mutation originated.

Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance remains largely unknown. Blood sequencing data from \textasciitilde 50,000 individuals reveal how mutation, genetic drift, and fitness shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood (clonal hematopoiesis). We show that positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal hematopoiesis, provide bounds on the number of hematopoietic stem cells, and quantify the fitness advantages of key pathogenic variants, at single-nucleotide resolution, as well as the distribution of fitness effects (fitness landscape) within commonly mutated driver genes. These data are consistent with clonal hematopoiesis being driven by a continuing risk of mutations and clonal expansions that become increasingly detectable with age.},

In genomes of different organisms, the gene conversion process is biased toward GC, which is irrespective of mutation bias. In the coding region, this trend is especially obvious and it is possibly caused by the preference on G/C-ending codons over the A/T-ending ones. If the G/C-ending codons are advantageous, then the synonymous mutations that change A/T to G/C would be ?optimal? compared to the opposite ones. In theory, one should observe signals of positive selection on these optimal synonymous mutations. The recently released single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the 1001 genome project of Arabidopsis thaliana provided researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to verify this assumption. I fully take advantage of the SNP data from 1,135 A thaliana lines and came to the conclusion that synonymous mutations in natural populations are not strictly neutral: the synonymous mutations that increase GC content (from A/T to G/C) tend to have higher derived allele frequencies (DAFs) and, therefore, are likely to be positively selected. My current study broadens our knowledge of the selection patterns of synonymous mutations and should be appealing to evolutionary biologists.One sentence summary: In 1135 genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, the synonymous mutations that increase the GC content tend to have higher derived allele frequencies (DAFs) and are likely to be positively selected.},

Here, we leverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data on populations of modern maize, landrace, and teosinte (               Zea mays               ssp.               parviglumis)               to estimate epimutation rates and selection coefficients. We find weak evidence for direct selection on DNA methylation in any context, but thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are identified population-wide that are correlated with recent selection. For two trait-associated DMRs,               vgt1               -DMR and               tb1               -DMR, HiChIP data indicate that the interactive loops between DMRs and respective downstream genes are present in B73, a modern maize line, but absent in teosinte. Our results enable a better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on patterns of DNA methylation and suggest a role of methylation variation in adaptive evolution.},

  abstract = {RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as an important epigenetic modification for its role in regulating the stability, structure, processing, and translation of RNA. Instability of m6A homeostasis may result in flaws in stem cell regulation, decrease in fertility, and risk of cancer. To this day, experimental detection and quantification of RNA m6A modification are still time-consuming and labor-intensive. There is only a limited number of epitranscriptome samples in existing databases, and a matched RNA methylation profile is not often available for a biological problem of interests. As gene expression data are usually readily available for most biological problems, it could be appealing if we can estimate the RNA methylation status from gene expression data using in silico methods. In this study, we explored the possibility of computational prediction of RNA methylation status from gene expression data using classification and regression methods based on mouse RNA methylation data collected from 73 experimental conditions. Elastic Net-regularized Logistic Regression (ENLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) were constructed for classification. Both SVM and RF achieved the best performance with the mean area under the curve (AUC)\,=\,0.84 across samples; SVM had a narrower AUC spread. Gene Site Enrichment Analysis was conducted on those sites selected by ENLR as predictors to access the biological significance of the model. Three functional annotation terms were found statistically significant: phosphoprotein, SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain, and endoplasmic reticulum. All 3 terms were found to be closely related to m6A pathway. For regression analysis, Elastic Net was implemented, which yielded a mean Pearson correlation coefficient\,=\,0.68 and a mean Spearman correlation coefficient\,=\,0.64. Our exploratory study suggested that gene expression data could be used to construct predictors for m6A methylation status with adequate accuracy. Our work showed for the first time that RNA methylation status may be predicted from the matched gene expression data. This finding may facilitate RNA modification research in various biological contexts when a matched RNA methylation profile is not available, especially in the very early stage of the study.},

Frequency spectra of the haplogroups were population-specific and were heterogeneous among geographic regions within Japan. Application of machine learning methods could finely classify the subjects corresponding to the high-digit mtDNA sub-haplogroups. mtDNA had distinct genetic structures from that of nuclear DNA (nDNA), characterized by no distance-dependent linkage disequilibrium decay, sparse tagging of common variants, and the existence of common haplotypes spanning the entire mtDNA. We did not detect any evidence of mtDNA\textendash nDNA (or mtDNA copy number\textendash nDNA) genotype associations. Together with WGS-based mtDNA variant imputation, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of 147,437 Japanese individuals with 99 clinical phenotypes.

Given that there are many sequencing platforms used for SV identification and given that how best to visualize SVs together with other data, such as read alignments and annotations, depends on research goals, there are dozens of SV visualization tools designed for different research goals and sequencing platforms. Here, we provide a comprehensive survey of over 30 SV visualization tools to help users choose which tools to use. This review targets users who wish to visualize a set of SVs identified from the massively parallel sequencing reads of an individual human genome. We first categorize the ways in which SV visualization tools display SVs into ten major categories, which we denote as view modules. View modules allow readers to understand the features of each SV visualization tool quickly. Next, we introduce the features of individual SV visualization tools from several aspects, including whether SV views are integrated with annotations, whether long-read alignment is displayed, whether underlying data structures are graph-based, the type of SVs shown, whether auditing is possible, whether bird's eye view is available, sequencing platforms, and the number of samples. We hope that this review will serve as a guide for readers on the currently available SV visualization tools and lead to the development of new SV visualization tools in the near future.},

  abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genetic variants that are associated with many complex traits. However, their biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Transcriptomewide association studies (TWAS) have been recently proposed as an invaluable tool for investigating the potential gene regulatory mechanisms underlying variant-trait associations. Specifically, TWAS integrate GWAS with expression mapping studies based on a common set of variants and aim to identify genes whose GReX is associated with the phenotype. Various methods have been developed for performing TWAS and/or similar integrative analysis. Each such method has a different modeling assumption and many were initially developed to answer different biological questions. Consequently, it is not straightforward to understand their modeling property from a theoretical perspective. Results: We present a technical review on thirteen TWAS methods. Importantly, we show that these methods can all be viewed as two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, which has been widely applied in GWASs for examining the causal effects of exposure on outcome. Viewing different TWAS methods from an MR perspective provides us a unique angle for understanding their benefits and pitfalls. We systematically introduce the MR analysis framework, explain how features of the GWAS and expression data influence the adaptation of MR for TWAS, and re-interpret the modeling assumptions made in different TWAS methods from an MR angle. We finally describe future directions for TWAS methodology development. Conclusions: We hope that this review would serve as a useful reference for both methodologists who develop TWAS methods and practitioners who perform TWAS analysis.},

Current statistical approaches for the detection of ancient WGDs in a phylogenetic context have two main drawbacks. The first is that unwarranted restrictive assumptions on the ``background'' gene duplication and loss rates make inferences unreliable in the face of model violations. The second is that most methods can only be used to examine a limited set of a priori selected WGD hypotheses and cannot be used to discover WGDs in a phylogeny. In this study, we develop an approach for WGD inference using gene count data that seeks to overcome both issues. We employ a phylogenetic birth\textendash death model that includes WGD in a flexible hierarchical Bayesian approach and use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to perform Bayesian inference of branch-specific duplication, loss, and WGD retention rates across the space of WGD configurations. We evaluate the proposed method using simulations, apply it to data sets from flowering plants, and discuss the statistical intricacies of model-based WGD inference.},

  abstract = {Background: Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons (LTR retrotransposons) are mobile genetic elements composed of a few genes between terminal repeats and, in some cases, can comprise over half of a genome's content. Available data on LTR retrotransposons have facilitated comparative studies and provided insight on genome evolution. However, data are biased to model systems and marine organisms, including annelids, have been underrepresented in transposable elements studies. Here, we focus on genome of Lamellibrachia luymesi, a vestimentiferan tubeworm from deep-sea hydrocarbon seeps, to gain knowledge of LTR retrotransposons in a deep-sea annelid. Results: We characterized LTR retrotransposons present in the genome of L. luymesi using bioinformatic approaches and found that intact LTR retrotransposons makes up about 0.1\% of L. luymesi genome. Previous characterization of the genome has shown that this tubeworm hosts several known LTR-retrotransposons. Here we describe and classify LTR retrotransposons in L. luymesi as within the Gypsy, Copia and Bel-pao superfamilies. Although, many elements fell within already recognized families (e.g., Mag, CSRN1), others formed clades distinct from previously recognized families within these superfamilies. However, approximately 19\% (41) of recovered elements could not be classified. Gypsy elements were the most abundant while only 2 Copia and 2 Bel-pao elements were present. In addition, analysis of insertion times indicated that several LTR-retrotransposons were recently transposed into the genome of L. luymesi, these elements had identical LTR's raising possibility of recent or ongoing retrotransposon activity. Conclusions: Our analysis contributes to knowledge on diversity of LTR-retrotransposons in marine settings and also serves as an important step to assist our understanding of the potential role of retroelements in marine organisms. We find that many LTR retrotransposons, which have been inserted in the last few million years, are similar to those found in terrestrial model species. However, several new groups of LTR retrotransposons were discovered suggesting that the representation of LTR retrotransposons may be different in marine settings. Further study would improve understanding of the diversity of retrotransposons across animal groups and environments.},

The machine learning approach complements the experimental methods to minimize the resources required for essentiality assays. Previous studies revealed the need to discover relevant features that significantly classify essential genes, improve on the generalizability of prediction models across organisms, and construct a robust gold standard as the class label for the train data to enhance prediction. Findings also show that a significant limitation of the machine learning approach is predicting conditionally essential genes. The essentiality status of a gene can change due to a specific condition of the organism. This review examines various methods applied to essential gene prediction task, their strengths, limitations and the factors responsible for effective computational prediction of essential genes. We discussed categories of features and how they contribute to the classification performance of essentiality prediction models. Five categories of features, namely, gene sequence, protein sequence, network topology, homology and gene ontology-based features, were generated for Caenorhabditis elegans to perform a comparative analysis of their essentiality prediction capacity. Gene ontology-based feature category outperformed other categories of features majorly due to its high correlation with the genes' biological functions. However, the topology feature category provided the highest discriminatory power making it more suitable for essentiality prediction. The major limiting factor of machine learning to predict essential genes conditionality is the unavailability of labeled data for interest conditions that can train a classifier. Therefore, cooperative machine learning could further exploit models that can perform well in conditional essentiality predictions.                                         Short abstract               Identification of essential genes is imperative because it provides an understanding of the core structure and function, accelerating drug targets' discovery, among other functions. Recent studies have applied machine learning to complement the experimental identification of essential genes. However, several factors are limiting the performance of machine learning approaches. This review aims to present the standard procedure and resources available for predicting essential genes in organisms, and also highlight the factors responsible for the current limitation in using machine learning for conditional gene essentiality prediction. The choice of features and ML technique was identified as an important factor to predict essential genes effectively.},

TEs within genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II can be copied as parts of primary transcripts; however, their full contribution to mature transcript sequences remains unresolved. Here, using long and short read (LR and SR) RNA sequencing data, we show that 26\% of coding and 65\% of noncoding transcripts in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contain TE-derived sequences. Different TE families are incorporated into RNAs in unique patterns, with consequences to transcript structure and function. The presence of TE sequences within a transcript is correlated with TE-type specific changes in its subcellular distribution, alterations in steady-state levels and half-life, and differential association with RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs). We identify hPSC-specific incorporation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and LINE:L1 into protein-coding mRNAs, which generate TE sequence-derived peptides. Finally, single cell RNA-seq reveals that hPSCs express ERV-containing transcripts, whilst differentiating subpopulations lack ERVs and express SINE and LINE-containing transcripts. Overall, our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the incorporation of TE sequences into the RNAs of hPSCs is more widespread and has a greater impact than previously appreciated.},

Mitochondrial DNA variants may exist in a state of heteroplasmy, where a percentage of DNA molecules harbor a variant, or homoplasmy, where all DNA molecules have a variant. The relative quantity of mtDNA in a cell, or copy number (mtDNA-CN), is associated with mitochondrial function, human disease, and mortality. To facilitate accurate identification of heteroplasmy and quantify mtDNA-CN, we built a bioinformatics pipeline that takes whole genome sequencing data and outputs mitochondrial variants, and mtDNA-CN. We incorporate variant annotations to facilitate determination of variant significance. Our pipeline yields uniform coverage by remapping to a circularized chrM and recovering reads falsely mapped to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial sequences. Notably, we construct a consensus chrM sequence for each sample and recall heteroplasmy against the sample's unique mitochondrial genome. We observe an approximately 3-fold increased association with age for heteroplasmic variants in non-homopolymer regions and, are better able to capture genetic variation in the D-loop of chrM compared to existing software. Our bioinformatics pipeline more accurately captures features of mitochondrial genetics than existing pipelines that are important in understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to disease.},

Although the potential collective amount of available information is huge, the effective combination of such public sources is hindered by data heterogeneity, as the datasets exhibit a wide variety of notations and formats, concerning both experimental values and metadata. Thus, data integration is becoming a fundamental activity, to be performed prior to data analysis and biological knowledge discovery, consisting of subsequent steps of data extraction, normalization, matching and enrichment; once applied to heterogeneous data sources, it builds multiple perspectives over the genome, leading to the identification of meaningful relationships that could not be perceived by using incompatible data formats. In this paper, we first describe a technological pipeline from data production to data integration; we then propose a taxonomy of genomic data players (based on the distinction between contributors, repository hosts, consortia, integrators and consumers) and apply the taxonomy to describe about 30 important players in genomic data management. We specifically focus on the integrator players and analyse the issues in solving the genomic data integration challenges, as well as evaluate the computational environments that they provide to follow up data integration by means of visualization and analysis tools.},

These approaches ignore the effect of distalSNPs or other molecular effects underlying the SNP-gene association. Here, we outline multi-omics strategies for transcriptome imputation from germline genetics to allow more powerful testing of gene-trait associations by prioritizing distal-SNPs to the gene of interest. In one extension, we identify mediating biomarkers (CpG sites, microRNAs, and transcription factors) highly associated with gene expression and train predictive models for these mediators using their local SNPs. Imputed values for mediators are then incorporated into the final predictive model of gene expression, along with local SNPs. In the second extension, we assess distal-eQTLs (SNPs associated with genes not in a local window around it) for their mediation effect through mediating biomarkers local to these distal-eSNPs. DistaleSNPs with large indirect mediation effects are then included in the transcriptomic prediction model with the local SNPs around the gene of interest. Using simulations and real data from ROS/MAP brain tissue and TCGA breast tumors, we show considerable gains of percent variance explained (1\textendash 2\% additive increase) of gene expression and TWAS power to detect gene-trait associations. This integrative approach to transcriptome-wide imputation and association studies aids in identifying the complex interactions underlying genetic regulation within a tissue and important risk genes for various traits and disorders.},

Although machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of genomic sequence-related problems, the results are largely affected by the type and number of features extracted. This effect has motivated new algorithms and pipeline proposals, mainly involving feature extraction problems, in which extracting significant discriminatory information from a biological set is challenging. Considering this, our work proposes a new study of feature extraction approaches based on mathematical features (numerical mapping with Fourier, entropy and complex networks). As a case study, we analyze long non-coding RNA sequences. Moreover, we separated this work into three studies. First, we assessed our proposal with the most addressed problem in our review, e.g. lncRNA and mRNA; second, we also validate the mathematical features in different classification problems, to predict the class of lncRNA, e.g. circular RNAs sequences; third, we analyze its robustness in scenarios with imbalanced data. The experimental results demonstrated three main contributions: first, an in-depth study of several mathematical features; second, a new feature extraction pipeline; and third, its high performance and robustness for distinct RNA sequence classification.

One such example is yeast, which can transition between the sugars glucose and galactose as carbon sources. Boocock               et al.               show that this ability has undergone selection, resulting in the maintenance of two incompatible metabolic pathways in a select set of yeast strains within a single species. A phylogenetic analysis supports that these different pathways are mediated by three genes that differ between strains within and among yeast species and likely have been maintained over 10 million to 20 million years.

An information-theoretic measure of range of causal influence has recently been put forward in the literature. Starting from this formalization and relying upon Woodward's analysis, I show that an important problem associated with interpreting heritability causally, namely the locality problem, amounts, at least partly, to a low invariance and low stability between the genotype/environment and the phenotype of individuals. In light of this, I plead for a causal interpretation of heritability that takes the notions of Woodward's invariance and stability into consideration. In doing so, I defuse naive causal interpretations of heritability.},

Here we evaluate these opposing selection forces on introgressed ancestry between maize (               Zea mays               ssp.               mays               ) and its wild teosinte relative,               mexicana               (               Zea mays               ssp.               mexicana               ). Introgression from ecologically diverse teosinte may have facilitated maize's global range expansion, in particular to challenging high elevation regions ({$>$} 1500 m). We generated low-coverage genome sequencing data for 348 maize and               mexicana               individuals to evaluate patterns of introgression in 14 sympatric population pairs, spanning the elevational range of               mexicana               , a teosinte endemic to the mountains of Mexico. While recent hybrids are commonly observed in sympatric populations and               mexicana               demonstrates fine-scale local adaptation, we find that the majority of               mexicana               ancestry tracts introgressed into maize over 1000 generations ago. This               mexicana               ancestry seems to have maintained much of its diversity and likely came from a common ancestral source, rather than contemporary sympatric populations, resulting in relatively low               F                                ST                              between               mexicana               ancestry tracts sampled from geographically distant maize populations.                                         Introgressed               mexicana               ancestry in maize is reduced in lower-recombination rate quintiles of the genome and around domestication genes, consistent with pervasive selection against introgression. However, we also find               mexicana               ancestry increases across the sampled elevational gradient and that high introgression peaks are most commonly shared among high-elevation maize populations, consistent with introgression from               mexicana               facilitating adaptation to the highland environment. In the other direction, we find patterns consistent with adaptive and clinal introgression of maize ancestry into sympatric               mexicana               at many loci across the genome, suggesting that maize also contributes to adaptation in               mexicana               , especially at the lower end of its elevational range. In sympatric maize, in addition to high introgression regions we find many genomic regions where selection for local adaptation maintains steep gradients in introgressed               mexicana               ancestry across elevation, including at least two inversions: the well-characterized 14 Mb               Inv4m               on chromosome 4 and a novel 3 Mb inversion               Inv9f               surrounding the               macrohairless1               locus on chromosome 9. Most outlier loci with high               mexicana               introgression show no signals of sweeps or local sourcing from sympatric populations and so likely represent ancestral introgression sorted by selection, resulting in correlated but distinct outcomes of introgression in different contemporary maize populations.},

Improvements in version 2 include a full update of both the genomes and functional databases to those from eggNOG v5, as well as several efficiency enhancements and new features. Most notably, eggNOG-mapper v2 now allows for: 1) de novo gene prediction from raw contigs, 2) built-in pairwise orthology prediction, 3) fast protein domain discovery, and 4) automated GFF decoration. eggNOG-mapper v2 is available as a standalone tool or as an online service at http://eggnogmapper.embl.de.},

To achieve proper integration, joint Dimensionality Reduction (jDR) methods are among the most efficient approaches. However, several jDR methods are available, urging the need for a comprehensive benchmark with practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of nine representative jDR methods using three complementary benchmarks. First, we evaluate their performances in retrieving ground-truth sample clustering from simulated multi-omics datasets. Second, we use TCGA cancer data to assess their strengths in predicting survival, clinical annotations and known pathways/biological processes. Finally, we assess their classification of multi-omics single-cell data. From these in-depth comparisons, we observe that intNMF performs best in clustering, while MCIA offers an effective behavior across many contexts. The code developed for this benchmark study is implemented in a Jupyter notebook\textemdash multi-omics mix (momix)\textemdash to foster reproducibility, and support users and future developers.},

When inserted into some locations, TEs may disrupt gene regulation and cause diseases. Here, we present xTea (x-Transposable element analyzer), a tool for identifying TE insertions in whole-genome sequencing data. Whereas existing methods are mostly designed for short-read data, xTea can be applied to both short-read and long-read data. Our analysis shows that xTea outperforms other short read-based methods for both germline and somatic TE insertion discovery. With long-read data, we created a catalogue of polymorphic insertions with full assembly and annotation of insertional sequences for various types of retroelements, including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses. Notably, we find that individual genomes have an average of nine groups of full-length L1s in centromeres, suggesting that centromeres and other highly repetitive regions such as telomeres are a significant yet unexplored source of active L1s. xTea is available at               https://github.com/parklab/xTea               .},

Using a reference graph of 578 Escherichia coli genomes, we compare 20 diverse isolates.

  abstract = {The scale of genetic methods are presently being expanded: forensic genetic assays previously were limited to tens of loci, but now technologies allow for a transition to forensic genomic approaches that assess thousands to millions of loci. However, there are subtle distinctions between genetic assays and their genomic counterparts (especially in the context of forensics). For instance, forensic genetic approaches tend to describe a locus as a haplotype, be it a microhaplotype or a short tandem repeat with its accompanying flanking information. In contrast, genomic assays tend to provide not haplotypes but sequence variants or differences, variants which in turn describe how the alleles apparently differ from the reference sequence. By the given construction, mitochondrial genetic assays can be thought of as genomic as they often describe genetic differences in a similar way. The mitochondrial genetics literature makes clear that sequence differences, unlike the haplotypes they encode, are not comparable to each other. Different alignment algorithms and different variant calling conventions may cause the same haplotype to be encoded in multiple ways. This ambiguity can affect evidence and reference profile comparisons as well as how ``match'' statistics are computed. In this study, a graph algorithm is described (and implemented in the MMDIT (Mitochondrial Mixture Database and Interpretation Tool) R package) that permits the assessment of forensic match statistics on mitochondrial DNA mixtures in a way that is invariant to both the variant calling conventions followed and the alignment parameters considered. The algorithm described, given a few modest constraints, can be used to compute the ``random man not excluded'' statistic or the likelihood ratio. The performance of the approach is assessed in in silico mitochondrial DNA mixtures.},

With the cost of scRNA-seq decreasing and techniques for sample multiplexing improving, population-scale scRNA-seq, and thus single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) mapping, is increasingly feasible. Mapping of sc-eQTL provides additional resolution to study the regulatory role of common genetic variants on gene expression across a plethora of cell types and states and promises to improve our understanding of genetic regulation across tissues in both health and disease. Results: While previously established methods for bulk eQTL mapping can, in principle, be applied to sc-eQTL mapping, there are a number of open questions about how best to process scRNA-seq data and adapt bulk methods to optimize sceQTL mapping. Here, we evaluate the role of different normalization and aggregation strategies, covariate adjustment techniques, and multiple testing correction methods to establish best practice guidelines. We use both real and simulated datasets across single-cell technologies to systematically assess the impact of these different statistical approaches. Conclusion: We provide recommendations for future single-cell eQTL studies that can yield up to twice as many eQTL discoveries as default approaches ported from bulk studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Advances have recently been made in identifying the genetic basis of psychiatric and neurological disorders, however, fundamental questions about their evolutionary origins remain elusive. Here, introgressed variants from archaic humans such as Neandertals can serve as an intriguing research paradigm. Methods: We compared the number of associations for Neandertal variants to the number of associations of frequency-matched non-archaic variants with regard to human CNS disorders (neurological and psychiatric), nervous system drug prescriptions as a proxy for disease, and related non-disease phenotypes in the UK biobank (UKBB), the NESDA cohort and the Biobank Japan. Results: While no enrichment for Neandertal genetic variants were observed in the UKBB for psychiatric or neurological disease categories, we found significant associations with certain behavioral phenotypes including pain, chronotype/sleep, smoking and alcohol consumptions. Several of these associations were also observed in NESDA and the Biobank Japan, suggesting their evolutionary relevance across different ancestry backgrounds. Intriguingly, in some instances, the enrichment signal was driven by Neandertal variants that represented the strongest association genomewide. Conclusions: Our data suggest that evolutionary processes in recent human evolution like admixture with Neandertals significantly contribute to behavioral phenotypes but not psychiatric and neurological diseases. These findings help to link genetic variants in a population to putative past beneficial effects, which likely only indirectly contribute pathology in modern humans, possibly due to changes in lifestyle and maladaptation.},

  abstract = {Objective: Development of novel informatics methods focused on improving pregnancy outcomes remains an active area of research. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the ways that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), methodologies can inform patient care during pregnancy and improve outcomes. Materials and methods: We searched English articles on EMBASE, PubMed and SCOPUS. Search terms included ML, AI, pregnancy and informatics. We included research articles and book chapters, excluding conference papers, editorials and notes. Results: We identified 127 distinct studies from our queries that were relevant to our topic and included in the review. We found that supervised learning methods were more popular (n = 69) than unsupervised methods (n = 9). Popular methods included support vector machines (n = 30), artificial neural networks (n = 22), regression analysis (n = 17) and random forests (n = 16). Methods such as DL are beginning to gain traction (n = 13). Common areas within the pregnancy domain where AI and ML methods were used the most include prenatal care (e.g. fetal anomalies, placental functioning) (n = 73); perinatal care, birth and delivery (n = 20); and preterm birth (n = 13). Efforts to translate AI into clinical care include clinical decision support systems (n = 24) and mobile health applications (n = 9). Conclusions: Overall, we found that ML and AI methods are being employed to optimize pregnancy outcomes, including modern DL methods (n = 13). Future research should focus on less-studied pregnancy domain areas, including postnatal and postpartum care (n = 2). Also, more work on clinical adoption of AI methods and the ethical implications of such adoption is needed.},

  abstract = {RNA splicing, and variations in this process referred to as alternative splicing, are critical aspects of gene regulation in eukaryotes. From environmental responses in plants to being a primary link between genetic variation and disease in humans, splicing differences confer extensive phenotypic changes across diverse organisms (1\textendash 3). Regulation of splicing occurs through differential selection of splice sites in a splicing reaction, which results in variation in the abundance of isoforms and/or splicing events. However, genomic determinants that influence splice-site selection remain largely unknown. While traditional approaches for analyzing splicing rely on quantifying variant transcripts (i.e. isoforms) or splicing events (i.e. intron retention, exon skipping etc.) (4), recent approaches focus on analyzing complex/mutually exclusive splicing patterns (5\textendash 8). However, none of these approaches explicitly measure individual splice-site usage, which can provide valuable information about splice-site choice and its regulation. Here, we present a simple approach to quantify the empirical usage of individual splice sites reflecting their strength, which determines their selection in a splicing reaction. Splicesite strength/usage, as a quantitative phenotype, allows us to directly link genetic variation with usage of individual splice-sites. We demonstrate the power of this approach in defining the genomic determinants of splice-site choice through GWAS. Our pilot analysis with more than a thousand splice sites hints that sequence divergence in cis rather than trans is associated with variations in splicing among accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. This approach allows deciphering principles of splicing and has broad implications from agriculture to medicine.},

However, here we show that symmetries and patterns in the dsDNA sequence can emerge from the physical peculiarities of the dsDNA molecule itself and the maximum entropy principle alone, rather than from biological or environmental evolutionary pressure. The randomness justifies the human codon biases and context-dependent mutation patterns in human populations. Thus, the DNA `exceptional symmetries,' emerged from the randomness, have to be taken into account when looking for the DNA encoded information. Our results suggest that the double helix energy constraints and, more generally, the physical properties of the dsDNA are the hard drivers of the overall DNA sequence architecture, whereas the selective biological processes act as soft drivers, which only under extraordinary circumstances overtake the overall entropy content of the genome.},

  abstract = {Ancient human migrations led to the settlement of population groups in varied environmental contexts worldwide. The extent to which adaptation to local environments has shaped human genetic diversity is a longstanding question in human evolution. Recent studies have suggested that introgression of archaic alleles in the genome of modern humans may have contributed to adaptation to environmental pressures such as pathogen exposure. Functional genomic studies have demonstrated that variation in gene expression across individuals and in response to environmental perturbations is a main mechanism underlying complex trait variation. We considered gene expression response to               in vitro               treatments as a molecular phenotype to identify genes and regulatory variants that may have played an important role in adaptations to local environments. We investigated if Neanderthal introgression in the human genome may contribute to the transcriptional response to environmental perturbations. To this end we used eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in a panel of 52 cellular environments, resulting from 5 cell types and 26 treatments, including hormones, vitamins, drugs, and environmental contaminants. We found that SNPs with introgressed Neanderthal alleles (N-SNPs) disrupt binding of transcription factors important for environmental responses, including ionizing radiation and hypoxia, and for glucose metabolism. We identified an enrichment for N-SNPs among eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in response to 8 treatments, including glucocorticoids, caffeine, and vitamin D. Using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) data, we validated the regulatory function of 21 introgressed Neanderthal variants in the human genome, corresponding to 8 eQTLs regulating 15 genes that respond to environmental perturbations. These findings expand the set of environments where archaic introgression may have contributed to adaptations to local environments in modern humans and provide experimental validation for the regulatory function of introgressed variants.},

  abstract = {Of Chargaff's four "rules" on DNA base frequencies, the functional interpretation of his second parity rule (PR2) is the most contentious. Thermophile base compositions (GC\%) were taken by Galtier and Lobry (1997) as favoring Sueoka's neutral PR2 hypothesis over Forsdyke's selective PR2 hypothesis, namely that mutations improving local within-species recombination efficiency had generated a genome-wide potential for the strands of duplex DNA to separate and initiate recombination through the "kissing" of the tips of stem-loops. However, following Chargaff's GC rule, base composition mainly reflects a species-specific, genome-wide, evolutionary pressure. GC\% could not have consistently followed the dictates of temperature, since it plays fundamental roles in both sustaining species integrity and, through primarily neutral genome-wide mutation, fostering speciation. Evidence for a local within-species recombination-initiating role of base order was obtained with a novel technology that masked the contribution of base composition to nucleic acid folding energy. Forsdyke's results were consistent with his PR2 hypothesis, appeared to resolve some root problems in biology and provided a theoretical underpinning for alignment-free taxonomic analyses using relative oligonucleotide frequencies (k-mer analysis). Moreover, consistent with Chargaff's cluster rule, discovery of the thermoadaptive role of the "purine-loading" of open reading frames made less tenable the Galtier-Lobry anti-selectionist arguments.},

Our Biological Insights Knowledge Graph (BIKG) combines relevant data for drug development from public as well as internal data sources to provide insights for a range of tasks: from identifying new targets to repurposing existing drugs. Besides the common requirements to organisational knowledge graphs such as being able to capture the domain precisely and give the users the ability to search and query the data, the focus on handling multiple use cases and supporting use case-specific machine learning models presents additional challenges: the data models must also be streamlined for the performance of downstream tasks; graph content must be easily customisable for different use cases; different projections of the graph content are required to support a wider range of different consumption modes. In this paper we describe our main design choices in implementation of the BIKG graph and discuss different aspects of its life cycle: from graph construction to exploitation.},

However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in this fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.},

Non-B DNA also hinders replication, increasing errors and facilitating mutagenesis, yet its contribution to genome-wide variation in mutation rates remains unexplored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of nucleotide substitution frequencies at non-B DNA loci within noncoding, non-repetitive genome regions, their {$\pm$}2 kb flanking regions, and 1-Megabase windows, using human-orangutan divergence and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Functional data analysis at single-base resolution demonstrated that substitution frequencies are usually elevated at non-B DNA, with patterns specific to each non-B DNA type. Mirror, direct and inverted repeats have higher substitution frequencies in spacers than in repeat arms, whereas G-quadruplexes, particularly stable ones, have higher substitution frequencies in loops than in stems. Several non-B DNA types also affect substitution frequencies in their flanking regions. Finally, non-B DNA explains more variation than any other predictor in multiple regression models for diversity or divergence at 1-Megabase scale. Thus, non-B DNA substantially contributes to variation in substitution frequencies at small and large scales. Our results highlight the role of non-B DNA in germline mutagenesis with implications to evolution and genetic diseases.},

  abstract = {In large complex plant genomes, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) ensures that epigenetic silencing is maintained at the boundary between genes and flanking transposable elements. In maize, RdDM is dependent on Mediator of Paramutation1 (Mop1), a gene encoding a putative RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Here we show that although RdDM is essential for the maintenance of DNA methylation of a silenced MuDR transposon in maize, a loss of that methylation does not result in a restoration of activity. Instead, heritable maintenance of silencing is maintained by histone modifications. At one terminal inverted repeat (TIR) of this element, heritable silencing is mediated via histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and histone H3 lysine 27 dimethylation (H3K27me2), even in the absence of DNA methylation. At the second TIR, heritable silencing is mediated by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a mark normally associated with somatically inherited gene silencing. We find that a brief exposure of high temperature in a mop1 mutant rapidly reverses both of these modifications in conjunction with a loss of transcriptional silencing. These reversals are heritable, even in mop1 wild-type progeny in which methylation is restored at both TIRs. These observations suggest that DNA methylation is neither necessary to maintain silencing, nor is it sufficient to initiate silencing once has been reversed. However, given that heritable reactivation only occurs in a mop1 mutant background, these observations suggest that DNA methylation is required to buffer the effects of environmental stress on transposable elements.},

This surge of information has given rise to concept of interdisciplinary fields, which has resulted in emergence of newer research domains, one of them is `Synthetic Biology' (SynBio). It captures basics from core biology and integrates it with concepts from the other areas of study such as chemical, electrical, and computational sciences. The essence of synthetic biology is to rewire, re-program, and re-create natural biological pathways, which are carried through genetic circuits. A genetic circuit is a functional assembly of basic biological entities (DNA, RNA, proteins), created using typical design, built, and test cycles. These circuits allow scientists to engineer nearly all biological systems for various useful purposes. The development of sophisticated molecular tools, techniques, genomic programs, and ease of nucleic acid synthesis have further fueled several innovative application of synthetic biology in areas like molecular medicines, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, drug discovery, metabolomics, developing plant biosensors, utilization of prokaryotic systems for metabolite production, and CRISPR/Cas9 in the crop improvement. These applications have largely been dominated by utilization of prokaryotic systems. However, newer researches have indicated positive growth of SynBio for the eukaryotic systems as well. This paper explores advances of synthetic biology in the plant field by elaborating on its core components and potential applications. Here, we have given a comprehensive idea of designing, development, and utilization of synthetic biology in the improvement of the present research state of plant system.},

However, the relative contribution of these three transcriptomic regulatory layers to cell type specification is poorly understood. This question is particularly relevant to neurons, given their extensive heterogeneity associated with brain location, morphology and function. In the present study, we generated profiles for the three regulatory layers from developmentally and regionally distinct subpopulations of neurons from the mouse hippocampus and broader nervous system. Multi-omics factor analyses revealed differing contributions of each transcriptomic layer in the discrimination of neurons based on their stage of development, region, and function. Importantly, profiles of differential alternative splicing and polyadenylation better discriminated specific neuronal subtype populations than gene expression patterns. These results provide evidence for differential relative contributions of coordinated gene regulatory layers in the specification of neuronal subtypes.},

As interest grows in more dynamic representations of movement potential, modelers are often limited by the capacity of their analytic tools to handle these datasets. Technology developments in software and high-performance computing are rapidly emerging in many fields, but uptake within conservation may lag, as our tools or our choice of computing language can constrain our ability to keep pace. We recently updated Circuitscape, a widely used connectivity analysis tool developed by Brad McRae and Viral Shah, by implementing it in Julia, a high-performance computing language. In this initial re-code (Circuitscape 5.0) and later updates, we improved computational efficiency and parallelism, achieving major speed improvements, and enabling assessments across larger extents or with higher resolution data. Here, we reflect on the benefits to conservation of strengthening collaborations with computer scientists, and extract examples from a collection of 572 Circuitscape applications to illustrate how through a decade of repeated investment in the software, applications have been many, varied, and increasingly dynamic. Beyond empowering continued innovations in dynamic connectivity, we expect that faster run times will play an important role in facilitating coproduction of connectivity assessments with stakeholders, increasing the likelihood that connectivity science will be incorporated in land use decisions.},

Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Using a cis-regulatory editing drive system, we generate a comprehensive allelic series in tomato, which revealed hidden pleiotropic roles for WOX9. Analysis of accessible chromatin and conserved cis-regulatory sequences identifies the regions responsible for this pleiotropic activity, the functions of which are conserved in groundcherry, a tomato relative. Mimicking these alleles in Arabidopsis, distantly related to tomato and groundcherry, reveals new inflorescence phenotypes, exposing a deeply conserved pleiotropy.

Other genomic elements code for the expression and processing of RNA transcripts. However, over 50\% of the human genome consists of widely dispersed repetitive sequences. Among these are simple sequence repeats (SSRs), representing a class of flipons, that under physiological conditions, form alternative nucleic acid conformations such as Z-DNA, G4 quartets, I-motifs, and triplexes. Proteins that bind in a structure-specific manner enable the seeding of condensates with the potential to regulate a wide range of biological processes. SSRs also encode the low complexity peptide repeats to patch condensates together, increasing the number of combinations possible. In situations where SSRs are transcribed, SSR-specific, single-stranded binding proteins may further impact condensate formation. Jointly, flipons and patches speed evolution by enhancing the functionality of condensates. Here, the focus is on the selection of SSR flipons and peptide patches that solve for survival under a wide range of environmental contexts, generating complexity with simple parts.},

  abstract = {Colocalization analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to uncover the overlapping of causal variants responsible for both molecular and complex disease phenotypes. The findings from colocalization analysis yield insights into the molecular pathways of complex diseases. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the promise and limitations of the available colocalization analysis approaches. Focusing on variant-level colocalization approaches, we first establish the connections between various existing methods. We proceed to discuss the impacts of various controllable analytical factors and uncontrollable practical factors on outcomes of colocalization analysis through realistic simulations and real data examples. We identify a single analytical factor, the specification of prior enrichment levels, which can lead to severe inflation of false-positive colocalization findings. Meanwhile, the combination of many other analytical and practical factors all lead to diminished power. Consequently, we recommend the following strategies for the best practice of colocalization analysis: (1) estimating prior enrichment level from the observed data and (2) separating fine-mapping and colocalization analysis. Our analysis of 4,091 complex traits and the multi-tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from the GTEx (v.8) suggests that colocalizations of molecular QTLs and causal complex trait associations are widespread. However, only a small proportion can be confidently identified from currently available data due to a lack of power. Our findings set a benchmark for current and future integrative genetic association analysis applications.},

  abstract = {Enhancers represent noncoding regulatory regions of the genome located distantly from their target genes. They regulate gene expression programs in a context-specific manner via interacting with promoters of one or more target genes and are generally associated with transcription factor binding sites and epi(genomic)/chromatin features, such as regions of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. The enhancers are difficult to identify due to the modularity of their associated features. Although enhancers have been studied extensively in human and animals, only a handful of them has been identified in few plant species till date due to nonavailability of plant-specific experimental and computational approaches for their discovery. Being an important regulatory component of the genome, enhancers represent potential targets for engineering agronomic traits, including salinity stress tolerance in plants. Here, we provide a review of the available experimental and computational approaches along with the associated sequence and chromatin/epigenetic features for the discovery of enhancers in plants. In addition, we provide insights into the challenges and future prospects of enhancer research in plant biology with emphasis on potential applications in engineering salinity stress tolerance in crop plants.},

These biological networks provide a wealth of raw materials for further understanding of biological systems, the discovery of complex diseases and the search for therapeutic drugs. However, the increase in data also increases the difficulty of biological networks analysis. Therefore, algorithms that can handle large, heterogeneous and complex data are needed to better analyze the data of these network structures and mine their useful information. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that extracts more abstract features from a larger set of training data. Through the establishment of an artificial neural network with a network hierarchy structure, deep learning can extract and screen the input information layer by layer and has representation learning ability. The improved deep learning algorithm can be used to process complex and heterogeneous graph data structures and is increasingly being applied to the mining of network data information. In this paper, we first introduce the used network data deep learning models. After words, we summarize the application of deep learning on biological networks. Finally, we discuss the future development prospects of this field.},

CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns.

Through applying these techniques to omics data, systems biology addresses the problems posed by the complex organization of biological processes. In this Review, we describe the techniques and sources of omics data, outline network theory, and highlight exemplars of novel approaches that combine gene regulatory and co-expression networks, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and phenomics with informatics techniques to provide new insights into cardiovascular disease. The use of systems approaches will become necessary to integrate data from more than one omic technique. Although understanding the interactions between different omics data requires increasingly complex concepts and methods, we argue that hypothesis-driven investigations and independent validation must still accompany these novel systems biology approaches to realize their full potential.},

Our development of the Pathway Tools software was motivated by the need to construct biological knowledge resources that combine these many types of data, and that enable users to find and comprehend data of interest as quickly as possible through query and visualization tools. Further, we sought to support the development of metabolic flux models from pathway databases, and to use pathway information to leverage the interpretation of high-throughput data sets.                                         Results               In the past 4 years we have enhanced the already extensive Pathway Tools software in several respects. It can now support metabolic-model execution through the Web, it provides a more accurate gap filler for metabolic models; it supports development of models for organism communities distributed across a spatial grid; and model results may be visualized graphically. Pathway Tools supports several new omics-data analysis tools including the Omics Dashboard, multi-pathway diagrams called pathway collages, a pathway-covering algorithm for metabolomics data analysis and an algorithm for generating mechanistic explanations of multi-omics data. We have also improved the core pathway/genome databases management capabilities of the software, providing new multi-organism search tools for organism communities, improved graphics rendering, faster performance and re-designed gene and metabolite pages.

However, technical differences between these datasets are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue (               https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl               ), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are freely available to enable the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues.},

We show that Nanopore-based assemblies are highly accurate in coding regions, particularly with respect to coding insertions and deletions.

One intriguing possibility is that DNA sequences with special patterns play biological roles, adopting non-B-DNA conformations. Here we investigated dynamics of thymineguanine (TG) repeats, microsatellite sequences and recurrently found in promoters, as well as cytosine\textendash guanine (CG) repeats, best-known Z-DNA forming sequence, in the aspect of Z-DNA formation. We measured the energy barriers of the B\textendash Z transition with those repeats and discovered the sequencedependent penalty for Z-DNA generates distinctive thermodynamic and kinetic features in the torqueinduced transition. Due to the higher torsional stress required for Z-form in TG repeats, a bubble could be induced more easily, suppressing Z-DNA induction, but facilitate the B\textendash Z interconversion kinetically at the transition midpoint. Thus, the Z-form by TG repeats has advantages as a torsion buffer and bubble selector while the Z-form by CG repeats likely behaves as torsion absorber. Our statistical physics model supports quantitatively the populations of ZDNA and reveals the pivotal roles of bubbles in state dynamics. All taken together, a quantitative picture for the transition was deduced within the close interplay among bubbles, plectonemes and Z-DNA.},

The abundance of high-quality multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics and phenomics) for the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana enables scientists to study the genetic mechanism of many biological processes. However, no resource is available to provide comprehensive and systematic multi-omics associations for Arabidopsis. Here, we developed an Arabidopsis thaliana Multi-omics Association Database (AtMAD, http://www.megabionet.org/atmad), a public repository for large-scale measurements of associations between genome, transcriptome, methylome, pathway and phenotype in Arabidopsis, designed for facilitating identification of eQTL, emQTL, Pathway-mQTL, Phenotype-pathway, GWAS, TWAS and EWAS. Candidate variants/methylations/genes were identified in AtMAD for specific phenotypes or biological processes, many of them are supported by experimental evidence. Based on the multi-omics association strategy, we have identified 11 796 cis-eQTLs and 10 119 trans-eQTLs. Among them, 68 837 environment-eQTL associations and 149 622 GWAS-eQTL associations were identified and stored in AtMAD. For expression\textendash methylation quantitative trait loci (emQTL), we identified 265 776 emQTLs and 122 344 pathway-mQTLs. For TWAS and EWAS, we obtained 62 754 significant phenotype-gene associations and 3 993 379 significant phenotype-methylation associations, respectively.

The flexibility in the number of nodes in each hyperedge, which provides the expressiveness of hypergraphs, brings about structural differences between graphs and hypergraphs. Especially, the overlaps of hyperedges lead to complex high-order relations beyond pairwise relations, raising new questions that have not been considered in graphs: How do hyperedges overlap in real-world hypergraphs? Are there any pervasive characteristics? What underlying process can cause such patterns? In this work, we closely investigate thirteen real-world hypergraphs from various domains and share interesting observations of the overlaps of hyperedges. To this end, we define principled measures and statistically compare the overlaps of hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs and those in null models. Additionally, based on the observations, we propose HyperLap, a realistic hypergraph generative model. HyperLap is (a) Realistic: it accurately reproduces overlapping patterns of real-world hypergraphs, (b) Automatically Fittable: its parameters can be tuned automatically using HyperLap+ to generate hypergraphs particularly similar to a given target hypergraph, (c) Scalable: it generates and fits a hypergraph with 0.7 billion hyperedges within few hours.},

  abstract = {A pan-genome is the nonredundant collection of genes and/or DNA sequences in a species. Numerous studies have shown that plant pan-genomes are typically much larger than the genome of any individual and that a sizable fraction of the genes in any individual are present in only some genomes. The construction and interpretation of plant pan-genomes are challenging due to the large size and repetitive content of plant genomes. Most pangenomes are largely focused on nontransposable element protein coding genes because they are more easily analyzed and defined than noncoding and repetitive sequences. Nevertheless, noncoding and repetitive DNA play important roles in determining the phenotype and genome evolution. Fortunately, it is now feasible to make multiple high-quality genomes that can be used to construct high-resolution pan-genomes that capture all the variation. However, assembling, displaying, and interacting with such high-resolution pan-genomes will require the development of new tools.},

  abstract = {Standard approaches to characterising genetic variation revolve around mapping reads to a reference genome, but high genetic diversity leads to biases in mapping and variation detection. Genome graphs have been proposed as a means to address this and alleviate mapping bias. However when genotyping genome graphs, we need to define which variant sites are in the graph and what reference to express them against. Notably, with enough samples or in highly diverse genomic regions ''nested variation'' naturally occurs- a long deletion which is an alternate allele to multiple SNPs, or diverged haplotypes with small variants on top of each. There is currently no tool that models these relationships and meaningfully outputs variation at multiple scales. We demonstrate our software gramtools can accurately genotype dense variation at multiple scales, outperforming reference-based variant callers and state of the art genome graph tools on two datasets of microbial pathogens. Many species and genes of great interest harbour high levels of genetic diversity where multiscale variation naturally occurs and requires consideration. We provide a new output format for accessing all variation in directed acyclic genome graphs allowing straightforward genotyping of sample cohorts, finer resolution of genetic variation and the definition of alternate references.},

  abstract = {Since their inception, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than a hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci that are associated with various complex human diseases or traits. The majority of GWAS discoveries are located in non-coding regions of the human genome and have unknown functions. The valley between non-coding GWAS discoveries and downstream affected genes hinders the investigation of complex disease mechanism and the utilization of human genetics for the improvement of clinical care. Meanwhile, advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies reveal important genomic regulatory roles that non-coding regions play in the transcriptional activities of genes. In this review, we focus on data integrative bioinformatics methods that combine GWAS with functional genomics knowledge to identify genetically regulated genes. We categorize and describe two types of data integrative methods. First, we describe fine-mapping methods. Fine-mapping is an exploratory approach that calibrates likely causal variants underneath GWAS signals. Fine-mapping methods connect GWAS signals to potentially causal genes through statistical methods and/or functional annotations. Second, we discuss gene-prioritization methods. These are hypothesis generating approaches that evaluate whether genetic variants regulate genes via certain genetic regulatory mechanisms to influence complex traits, including colocalization, mendelian randomization, and the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS is a gene-based association approach that investigates associations between genetically regulated gene expression and complex diseases or traits. TWAS has gained popularity over the years due to its ability to reduce multiple testing burden in comparison to other variant-based analytic approaches. Multiple types of TWAS methods have been developed with varied methodological designs and biological hypotheses over the past 5 years. We dive into discussions of how TWAS methods differ in many aspects and the challenges that different TWAS methods face. Overall, TWAS is a powerful tool for identifying complex trait-associated genes. With the advent of single-cell sequencing, chromosome conformation capture, gene editing technologies, and multiplexing reporter assays, we are expecting a more comprehensive understanding of genomic regulation and genetically regulated genes underlying complex human diseases and traits in the future.},

In contrast, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) detects associations between gene expression levels and phenotypic variation. It has previously been shown that in the cross-pollinated species, maize (Zea mays), GWAS, and TWAS identify complementary sets of trait-associated genes, many of which exhibit characteristics of true positives. Here, we extend this conclusion to the self-pollinated species, Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean (Glycine max). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) can result in the identification, via GWAS, of false-positive associations. In all three analyzed plant species, most trait-associated genes identified via TWAS are well separated physically from other candidate genes. Hence, TWAS is less affected by LD than is GWAS, demonstrating that TWAS is particularly well suited for association studies in genomes with slow rates of LD decay, such as soybean. TWAS is reasonably robust to the plant organs/tissues used to determine expression levels. In summary, this study confirms that TWAS is a promising approach for accurate gene-level association mapping in plants that is complementary to GWAS, and established that TWAS can exhibit substantial advantages relative to GWAS in species with slow rates of LD decay.},

Existing TWAS methods are primarily univariate in nature, focusing on analyzing one outcome trait at a time. However, many complex traits are correlated with each other and share a common genetic basis. Consequently, analyzing multiple traits jointly through multivariate analysis can potentially improve the power of TWASs. Here, we develop a method, moPMR-Egger (multiple outcome probabilistic Mendelian randomization with Egger assumption), for analyzing multiple outcome traits in TWAS applications. moPMR-Egger examines one gene at a time, relies on its cis-SNPs that are in potential linkage disequilibrium with each other to serve as instrumental variables, and tests its causal effects on multiple traits jointly. A key feature of moPMR-Egger is its ability to test and control for potential horizontal pleiotropic effects from instruments, thus maximizing power while minimizing false associations for TWASs. In simulations, moPMR-Egger provides calibrated type I error control for both causal effects testing and horizontal pleiotropic effects testing and is more powerful than existing univariate TWAS approaches in detecting causal associations. We apply moPMR-Egger to analyze 11 traits from 5 trait categories in the UK Biobank. In the analysis, moPMR-Egger identified 13.15\% more gene associations than univariate approaches across trait categories and revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms underlying systolic and diastolic blood pressures.},

  abstract = {Germline defense against transposons                            Genomes of germ cells present an existential vulnerability to organisms because germ cell mutations will propagate to future generations. Transposable elements are one source of such mutations. In the small flowering plant               Arabidopsis               , Long               et al.               found that genome methylation in the male germline is directed by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) imperfectly transcribed from transposons (see the Perspective by Mosher). These germline siRNAs silence germline transposons and establish inherited methylation patterns in sperm, thus maintaining the integrity of the plant genome across generations.

Epigenetic marks are inherited through germlines, which can undergo epigenetic reprogramming that affects germline function. Mammalian germlines undergo genome-wide demethylation and remethylation, which resets epigenetic marks and restores cellular pluripotency. Germlines of flowering plants differentiate later than those of mammals and undergo distinct DNA methylation reprogramming. Global methylation level changes have been observed in plant germ cells, as well as local de novo methylation that regulates germline gene expression. However, the reprogramming mechanism remains unclear, which limits the understanding of tissue-specific and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants.                                         RATIONALE                                De novo methylation of genes in the                 Arabidopsis                 male germline is catalyzed by the small RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (RdDM). RdDM uses 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from a source locus, typically a transposon, to guide methyltransferases to methylate the cognate region. RdDM is ubiquitous among cells and normally methylates transposons. We investigated how RdDM targets genes in the germline, how such reprogramming is limited to the germline, and how the hundreds of target genes are selected.                                                        RESULTS                                We show that in                 Arabidopsis                 , germline-specific methylation at hundreds of genes is established by 24-nt siRNAs transcribed from hypermethylated transposons with imperfect sequence homology. CRISPR deletion of siRNA source transposons abolishes DNA methylation at corresponding genes in male meiocytes, demonstrating the ability of these siRNAs to target methylation in trans with mismatches. Furthermore, we found that meiocytes are quiescent in 24-nt siRNA biogenesis, and the gene targeting siRNAs are produced in tapetal nurse cells and transported into meiocytes. The siRNA profile of tapetal cells resembles that of meiocytes, suggesting bulk siRNA movement through the cytoplasmic channels (known as plasmodesmata) that connect these cells during early meiosis. Although gene-targeting siRNAs accumulate to levels in the tapetum comparable with those in meiocytes, the target genes are not methylated in the tapetum, showing that meiocytes can use imperfectly matching siRNAs to target DNA methylation.                                               We also show that the biogenesis of gene-targeting siRNAs in the tapetum is driven by a putative chromatin remodeler, CLASSY3 (CLSY3). CLSY3 is absent in vegetative tissues but enriched in female and male organs. In male organs, CLSY3 is specifically expressed in tapetal cells. The                 clsy3                 mutation eliminates de novo methylation at genes in male meiocytes as well as sperm, revealing the role of tapetal siRNAs in driving methylation reprogramming throughout the male germline. This conclusion was reinforced with experiments with a genetic mosaic system that restricted siRNA biogenesis to the tapetum. In the mosaic lines, tapetal siRNAs restore methylation in the male germline at genes specifically methylated in the germline and at transposons targeted by RdDM in all tissues. This shows that tapetal siRNAs shape the full spectrum of RNA-directed DNA methylation throughout the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm.                                               As tapetal siRNAs induce methylation at transposons in the male germline, we investigated whether these siRNAs serve to silence germline transposons in addition to their gene regulatory function. We found that tapetal siRNAs methylate and prevent the expression of a Gypsy retrotransposon (                 GP1                 ) that is specifically active in reproductive cells, demonstrating that tapetal siRNAs ensure germline genome integrity by suppressing transposons.                                                        CONCLUSION               Our work reveals the role of tapetum-derived 24-nt siRNAs in determining the paternal methylome. Tapetal siRNAs drive de novo methylation at genes in the germline and safeguard genome integrity by silencing transposons. The ability of meiocytes to use mismatched 24-nt siRNAs to induce methylation allows RdDM to target sequences similar to those of transposons that produce siRNAs in the tapetum. This should facilitate recognition and silencing of new transposons, indicating that meiosis is a key stage for genome surveillance and allows RdDM to specifically regulate germline gene expression. The broad targeting competence of tapetal siRNAs resembles that of metazoan gonad-expressed Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), suggesting convergent evolution of specialized small RNA pathways to control transposons and genes in plant and animal germlines.                                                   Tapetal siRNAs shape germline DNA methylation.                   RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) transcripts are processed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) and Dicer-Like 3 (DCL3) into 24-nt siRNAs. Tapetal siRNAs are transcribed from transposons, enabled by CLSY3 expression. Tapetal siRNAs move to meiocytes and induce methylation at corresponding transposons and genes with similar sequences. This genic methylation is germline-specific, indicating that the siRNA-targeted de novo methylation pathway is hypersensitive in meiocytes. TE, transposable element.                                                                      CREDIT: ADAPTED BY N.

Here, we reveal the molecular mechanism underlying this reprogramming. We demonstrate that genic methylation in the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm, is established by 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from transposons with imperfect sequence homology. These siRNAs are synthesized by meiocyte nurse cells (tapetum) through activity of CLSY3, a chromatin remodeler absent in other anther cells. Tapetal siRNAs govern germline methylation throughout the genome, including the inherited methylation patterns in sperm. Tapetum-derived siRNAs also silence germline transposons, safeguarding genome integrity. Our results reveal that tapetal siRNAs are sufficient to reconstitute germline methylation patterns and drive functional methylation reprogramming throughout the male germline.},

In this work, we solve VNTR mapping for short reads with a repeat-pangenome graph (RPGG), a data structure that encodes both the population diversity and repeat structure of VNTR loci from multiple haplotype-resolved assemblies. We develop software to build a RPGG, and use the RPGG to estimate VNTR composition with short reads. We use this to discover VNTRs with length stratified by continental population, and expression quantitative trait loci, indicating that RPGG analysis of VNTRs will be critical for future studies of diversity and disease.},

  abstract = {In the field of genome assembly, scaffolding methods make it possible to obtain a more complete and contiguous reference genome, which is the cornerstone of genomic research. Scaffolding methods typically utilize the alignments between contigs and sequencing data (reads) to determine the orientation and order among contigs and to produce longer scaffolds, which are helpful for genomic downstream analysis. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, diverse types of reads have emerged over the past decade, especially in long-range sequencing, which have greatly enhanced the assembly quality of scaffolding methods. As the number of scaffolding methods increases, biology and bioinformatics researchers need to perform in-depth analyses of state-of-the-art scaffolding methods. In this article, we focus on the difficulties in scaffolding, the differences in characteristics among various kinds of reads, the methods by which current scaffolding methods address these difficulties, and future research opportunities. We hope this work will benefit the design of new scaffolding methods and the selection of appropriate scaffolding methods for specific biological studies.},

To address these issues, we adapted the variant call format to store GWAS summary statistics (GWAS-VCF) and developed open-source tools to use this format in downstream analyses.

  abstract = {Clustering analysis has been widely used in trust evaluation on various complex networks such as wireless sensors networks and online social networks. Spectral clustering is one of the most commonly used algorithms for graph-structured data (networks). However, the conventional spectral clustering is inherently difficult to work with large-scale networks due to the fact that it needs computationally expensive matrix manipulations. To deal with large networks, in this paper, we propose an efficient graph clustering algorithm, KCoreMotif, specifically for large networks by exploiting k-core decomposition and motifs. The essential idea behind the proposed clustering algorithm is to perform the efficient motif-based spectral clustering algorithm on k-core subgraphs, rather than on the entire graph. More specifically, (1) we first conduct the k-core decomposition of the large input network; (2) we then perform the motif-based spectral clustering for the top k-core subgraphs; (3) we group the remaining vertices in the rest (k-1)-core subgraphs into previously found clusters; and finally obtain the desired clusters of the large input network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed graph clustering algorithm KCoreMotif, we use both the conventional and the motif-based spectral clustering algorithms as the baselines and compare our algorithm with them for 18 groups of real-world datasets. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed graph clustering algorithm is accurate yet efficient for large networks, which also means that it can be further used to evaluate the intra-cluster and inter-cluster trusts on large networks.},

Galtier and Lobry also assessed the relationship between RNA secondary structures (rRNA stems, tRNAs) and OGT, and in this case a clear relationship emerged. Increasing structured RNA G\,+\,C content (particularly in regions that are doublestranded) correlates with increased OGT. Both of these fundamental relationships have withstood test of many additional sequences and spawned a variety of different applications that include prediction of OGT from rRNA sequence and computational ncRNA identification approaches. In this work, I present the motivation behind Galtier and Lobry's original paper and the larger questions addressed by the work, how these questions have evolved over the last two decades, and the impact of Galtier and Lobry's manuscript in fields beyond these questions.},

In this study, we propose a computational pipeline which can detect 5mC sites in both CpG and non-CpG contexts of plant genomes by using Nanopore sequencing. And we sequenced two model plants Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) and Oryza sativa (O. sativa) by using Nanopore sequencing and bisulfite sequencing. The results of our proposed pipeline in the two plants achieved high correlations with bisulfite sequencing: above 0.98, 0.96, 0.85 for CpG, CHG, and CHH (H indicates A, C or T) motif, respectively. Our proposed pipeline also achieved high performance on Brassica nigra (B. nigra). Experiments also showed that our proposed pipeline can achieve high performance even with low coverage of reads. Moreover, by using Nanopore sequencing, our proposed pipeline is capable of profiling methylation of more cytosines than bisulfite sequencing.},

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 40 loci associated with AD risk. However, most of the disease-associated variants reside in non-coding regions of the genome, making it difficult to elucidate how they affect disease susceptibility. Nonetheless, identification of the regulatory elements, genes, pathways and cell type/tissue(s) impacted by these variants to modulate AD risk is critical to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and ability to develop effective therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of the methods and approaches used in the field to identify the functional effects of AD risk variants in the causal path to disease risk modification as well as describe the most recent findings. We first discuss efforts in cell type/tissue prioritization followed by recent progress in candidate causal variant and gene nomination. We discuss statistical methods for fine-mapping as well as approaches that integrate multiple levels of evidence, such as epigenomic and transcriptomic data, to identify causal variants and risk mechanisms of AD-associated loci. Additionally, we discuss experimental approaches and data resources that will be needed to validate and further elucidate the effects of these variants and genes on biological pathways, cellular phenotypes and disease risk. Finally, we discuss future steps that need to be taken to ensure that AD GWAS functional mapping efforts lead to novel findings and bring us closer to finding effective treatments for this devastating disease.},

Integrative analysis of multi-omics data can help scientists understand the condition or patient-specific gene regulation mechanisms. However, analysis of multi-omics data is challenging since it requires not only the analysis of multiple omics data sets but also mining complex relations among different genetic molecules by using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. In addition, analysis of multi-omics data needs quite large computing infrastructure. Moreover, interpretation of the analysis results requires collaboration among many scientists, often requiring reperforming analysis from different perspectives. Many of the aforementioned technical issues can be nicely handled when machine learning tools are deployed on the cloud. In this survey article, we first survey machine learning methods that can be used for gene regulation study, and we categorize them according to five different goals: gene regulatory subnetwork discovery, disease subtype analysis, survival analysis, clinical prediction and visualization. We also summarize the methods in terms of multi-omics input types. Then, we explain why the cloud is potentially a good solution for the analysis of multi-omics data, followed by a survey of two state-of-the-art cloud systems, Galaxy and BioVLAB. Finally, we discuss important issues when the cloud is used for the analysis of multi-omics data for the gene regulation study.},

  abstract = {Although the first ancient DNA molecules were extracted more than three decades ago, the first ancient nuclear genomes could only be characterized after high-throughput sequencing was invented. Genome-scale data have now been gathered from thousands of ancient archaeological specimens, and the number of ancient biological tissues amenable to genome sequencing is growing steadily. Ancient DNA fragments are typically ultrashort molecules and carry extensive amounts of chemical damage accumulated after death. Their extraction, manipulation and authentication require specific experimental wet-laboratory and dry-laboratory procedures before patterns of genetic variation from past individuals, populations and species can be interpreted. Ancient DNA data help to address an entire array of questions in anthropology, evolutionary biology and the environmental and archaeological sciences. The data have revealed a considerably more dynamic past than previously appreciated and have revolutionized our understanding of many major prehistoric and historic events. This Primer provides an overview of concepts and state-of-the-art methods underlying ancient DNA analysis and illustrates the diversity of resulting applications. The article also addresses some of the ethical challenges associated with the destructive analysis of irreplaceable material, emphasizes the need to fully involve archaeologists and stakeholders as part of the research design and analytical process, and discusses future perspectives.},

The identification and annotation of these elements via bioinformatics approaches represent a major challenge in the era of massive plant genome sequencing. In addition to their involvement in genome size variation, LTR retrotransposons are also associated with the function and structure of different chromosomal regions and can alter the function of coding regions, among others. Several sequence databases of plant LTR retrotransposons are available for public access, such as PGSB and RepetDB, or restricted access such as Repbase. Although these databases are useful to identify LTR-RTs in new genomes by similarity, the elements of these databases are not fully classified to the lineage (also called family) level. Here, we present InpactorDB, a semi-curated dataset composed of 130,439 elements from 195 plant genomes (belonging to 108 plant species) classified to the lineage level. This dataset has been used to train two deep neural networks (i.e., one fully connected and one convolutional) for the rapid classification of these elements. In lineage-level classification approaches, we obtain up to 98\% performance, indicated by the F1-score, precision and recall scores.},

They have key roles in nervous system development and function, as evidenced by recent results demonstrating the impact of microexons on behaviour and cognition. However, microexons are often overlooked due to the difficulty of detecting them using standard RNA-seq aligners. Results: Here, we present MicroExonator, a novel pipeline for reproducible de novo discovery and quantification of microexons. We process 289 RNA-seq datasets from eighteen mouse tissues corresponding to nine embryonic and postnatal stages, providing the most comprehensive survey of microexons available for mice. We detect 2984 microexons, 332 of which are differentially spliced throughout mouse embryonic brain development, including 29 that are not present in mouse transcript annotation databases. Unsupervised clustering of microexons based on their inclusion patterns segregates brain tissues by developmental time, and further analysis suggests a key function for microexons in axon growth and synapse formation. Finally, we analyse single-cell RNA-seq data from the mouse visual cortex, and for the first time, we report differential inclusion between neuronal subpopulations, suggesting that some microexons could be cell type-specific. Conclusions: MicroExonator facilitates the investigation of microexons in transcriptome studies, particularly when analysing large volumes of data. As a proof of principle, we use MicroExonator to analyse a large collection of both mouse bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The analyses enabled the discovery of previously uncharacterized microexons, and our study provides a comprehensive microexon inclusion catalogue during mouse development.},

We posit that different genomic aberrations generally exhibit a temporal order, shaped by a balance between the levels of mutations and selective pressures. Repeat instability emerges first, followed by larger aberrations, with compensatory effects leading to robust tumour fitness maintained throughout the tumour progression. A better understanding of the interplay between genetic aberrations, the microenvironment, and epigenetic and metabolic cellular states is essential for early detection and prevention of cancer as well as development of efficient therapeutic strategies.},

We are therefore witnessing the exponential growth of health-related information with the result that traditional analysis techniques are not suitable for satisfactorily management of this vast amount of data. AI applications (especially Deep Learning), on the other hand, are naturally predisposed to cope with this explosion of data, as they always work better as the amount of training data increases, a phase necessary to build the optimal neural network for a given clinical problem. This paper proposes a comprehensive and in-depth study of Deep Learning methodologies and applications in medicine.

  abstract = {Abstract           The size of a genome graph \textemdash{} the space required to store the nodes, their labels and edges \textemdash{} affects the efficiency of operations performed on it. For example, the time complexity to align a sequence to a graph without a graph index depends on the total number of characters in the node labels and the number of edges in the graph. The size of the graph also affects the size of the graph index that is used to speed up the alignment. This raises the need for approaches to construct space-efficient genome graphs.           We point out similarities in the string encoding approaches of genome graphs and the external pointer macro (EPM) compression model. Supported by these similarities, we present a pair of linear-time algorithms that transform between genome graphs and EPM-compressed forms. We show that the algorithms result in an upper bound on the size of the genome graph constructed based on an optimal EPM compression. In addition to the transformation, we show that equivalent choices made by EPM compression algorithms may result in different sizes of genome graphs. To further optimize the size of the genome graph, we purpose the source assignment problem that optimizes over the equivalent choices during compression and introduce an ILP formulation that solves that problem optimally. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce RLZ-Graph, a genome graph constructed based on the relative Lempel-Ziv EPM compression algorithm. We show that using RLZ-Graph, across all human chromosomes, we are able to reduce the disk space to store a genome graph on average by 40.7\% compared to colored de Bruijn graphs constructed by Bifrost under the default settings.

This global alignment algorithm is the best approach for identifying similar regions between sequences. This study presents a new application of classical machine learning (ML) to global sequence alignment. Customized ML models are used to implement NW global alignment. An accuracy of 99.7\% is achieved when using a multilayer perceptron with the ADAM optimizer, and up to 2912 Giga cell updates per second are realized on two real DNA sequences with a length of 4.1 M nucleotides. Our implementation is valid for RNA/DNA sequences. This study aims to parallelize the computation steps involved in the algorithm to accelerate its performance by using ML algorithms.

Short tandem repeats (STRs) consisting of repetitive DNA motifs have been shown to regulate gene expression. STRs are variable in length within a population and serve as a heritable, but semireversible, reservoir of standing genetic variation. For sessile organisms, such as plants, STRs could be of major importance in fine-tuning gene expression as a response to a shifting local environment. Here, we used a transcriptome dataset from natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate population-wide gene expression patterns in light of genome-wide STR variation. We empirically modeled gene expression as a response to the STR length within and around the gene and demonstrated that an association between gene expression and STR length variation is unequivocally present in the sampled population. To support our model, we explored the promoter activity in a transcriptional regulator involved in root hair formation and provided experimentally determined causality between coding sequence length variation and promoter activity. Our results support a general link between gene expression variation and STR length variation in A. thaliana.},

  abstract = {Genomic best linear-unbiased prediction (GBLUP) assumes equal variance for all marker effects, which is suitable for traits that conform to the infinitesimal model. For traits controlled by major genes, Bayesian methods with shrinkage priors or genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods can be used to identify causal variants effectively. The information from Bayesian/GWAS methods can be used to construct the weighted genomic relationship matrix (G). However, it remains unclear which methods perform best for traits varying in genetic architecture. Therefore, we developed several methods to optimize the performance of weighted GBLUP and compare them with other available methods using simulated and real data sets. First, two types of methods (marker effects with local shrinkage or normal prior) were used to obtain test statistics and estimates for each marker effect. Second, three weighted G matrices were constructed based on the marker information from the first step: (1) the genomic-feature-weighted G, (2) the estimated marker-variance-weighted G, and (3) the absolute value of the estimated marker-effect-weighted G. Following the above process, six different weighted GBLUP methods (local shrinkage/normal-prior GF/EV/AEWGBLUP) were proposed for genomic prediction. Analyses with both simulated and real data demonstrated that these options offer flexibility for optimizing the weighted GBLUP for traits with a broad spectrum of genetic architectures. The advantage of weighting methods over GBLUP in terms of accuracy was trait dependant, ranging from 14.8\% to marginal for simulated traits and from 44\% to marginal for real traits. Local-shrinkage prior EVWGBLUP is superior for traits mainly controlled by loci of a large effect. Normal-prior AEWGBLUP performs well for traits mainly controlled by loci of moderate effect. For traits controlled by some loci with large effects (explain 25\textendash 50\% genetic variance) and a range of loci with small effects, GFWGBLUP has advantages. In conclusion, the optimal weighted GBLUP method for genomic selection should take both the genetic architecture and number of QTLs of traits into consideration carefully.},

A recent development has been the discovery and use of accessible chromatin as a proxy for functional regulatory elements. However, the idea has recently arisen that DNA methylation data could supplement the use of accessible chromatin data for homing in on regulatory regions. Here, I test the robustness of using DNA methylation as a proxy for functional space. I find that CHG methylation can be nonarbitrarily partitioned into hypo-methylated and hyper-methylated regions. Hypomethylated CHG regions are stable across development and contain nearly all accessible chromatin.

Then Kuhnle et al. showed how to build the r-index efficiently via a technique called prefix-free parsing (PFP) and demonstrated its effectiveness for exact pattern matching. Exact pattern matching can be leveraged to support approximate pattern matching but the r-index itself cannot support efficiently popular and important queries such as finding maximal exact matches (MEMs). To address this shortcoming, Bannai et al. introduced the concept of thresholds, and showed that storing them together with the r-index enables efficient MEM finding \textemdash{} but they did not say how to find those thresholds. We present a novel algorithm that applies PFP to build the r-index and find the thresholds simultaneously and in linear time and space with respect to the size of the prefix-free parse.

This study aimed to (1) assemble               C. virginica               mitochondrial genomes from Texas with pooled restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ezRAD), (2) evaluate the validity of the mitochondrial genome assemblies including comparison with Sanger sequencing data, and (3) evaluate genetic differentiation both between the Delaware and Texas genomes, as well as among three bays in Texas. The pooled-genome-assembled-genomes (PAGs) from Texas exhibited several characteristics indicating that they were valid, including elevated nucleotide diversity in non-coding and the third position of codons, placement as the sister haplotype of the genome from Delaware in a phylogenetic reconstruction of               Crassostrea               mitochondrial genomes, and a lack of genetic structure in the ND4 gene among the three Texas bays as was found with Sanger amplicons in samples from the same bays several years prior. In the comparison between the Delaware and Texas genome, 27 of 38 coding regions exhibited variability between the two populations, which were differentiated by 273 mutations, versus 1\textendash 13 mutations among the Texas samples. Using the full PAGs, there was no additional evidence for population structure among the three Texas bays. While population genetics is rapidly moving towards larger high-density datasets, studies of mitochondrial DNA (and genomes) can be particularly useful for comparing historic data prior to the modern era of genomics. As such, being able to reliably compile mitochondrial genomes from genomic data can improve the ability to compare results across studies.},

  abstract = {K-mer-based methods are widely used in bioinformatics for various types of sequence comparison. However, a single mutation will mutate             k             consecutive k-mers and makes most k-mer based applications for sequence comparison sensitive to variable mutation rates. Many techniques have been studied to overcome this sensitivity,             e.g             ., spaced k-mers and k-mer permutation techniques, but these techniques do not handle indels well. For indels, pairs or groups of small k-mers are commonly used, but these methods first produce k-mer matches, and only in a second step, a pairing or grouping of k-mers is performed. Such techniques produce many redundant k-mer matches due to the size of             k             .                                   Here, we propose             strobemers             as an alternative to k-mers for sequence comparison. Intuitively, strobemers consist of linked minimizers. We use simulated data to show that strobemers provide more evenly distributed sequence matches and are less sensitive to different mutation rates than k-mers and spaced k-mers. Strobemers also produce a higher match coverage across sequences. We further implement a proof-of-concept sequence matching tool StrobeMap, and use synthetic and biological Oxford Nanopore sequencing data to show the utility of using strobemers for sequence comparison in different contexts such as sequence clustering and alignment scenarios. A reference implementation of our tool StrobeMap together with code for analyses is available at             https://github.com/ksahlin/strobemers             .},

  abstract = {Structural variants have a considerable impact on human genomic diversity. However, their evolutionary history remains mostly unexplored. Here, we developed a new method to identify potentially adaptive structural variants based on a network-based analysis that incorporates genotype frequency data from 26 populations simultaneously. Using this method, we analyzed 57,629 structural variants and identified 577 structural variants that show high population distribution. We further showed that 39 and 20 of these putatively adaptive structural variants overlap with coding sequences or are significantly associated with GWAS traits, respectively. Closer inspection of the haplotypic variation associated with these putatively adaptive and functional structural variants reveals deviations from neutral expectations due to (i) population differentiation of rapidly evolving multi-allelic variants, (ii) incomplete sweeps, and (iii) recent population-specific negative selection. Overall, our study provides new methodological insights, documents hundreds of putatively adaptive variants, and introduces evolutionary models that may better explain the complex evolution of structural variants.},

Furthermore, they embody the Tripal approach to FAIR data by providing multiple search tools and ensuring metadata is fully described and interoperable. Our solution focuses on data integrity, as well as optimizing performance to provide a fully functional system that is currently being used in the production of Tripal portals for crop species.

Experimental methods for identifying ncRNA\textendash protein interactions (NPIs) are always costly and time-consuming. Many computational approaches have been developed as alternative ways. In this work, we collected five benchmarking datasets for predicting NPIs. Based on these datasets, we evaluated and compared the prediction performances of existing machine-learning based methods. Graph neural network (GNN) is a recently developed deep learning algorithm for link predictions on complex networks, which has never been applied in predicting NPIs. We constructed a GNN-based method, which is called Noncoding RNA\textendash Protein Interaction prediction using Graph Neural Networks (NPI-GNN), to predict NPIs. The NPI-GNN method achieved comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods in a 5-fold cross-validation. In addition, it is capable of predicting novel interactions based on network information and sequence information. We also found that insufficient sequence information does not affect the NPI-GNN prediction performance much, which makes NPI-GNN more robust than other methods. As far as we can tell, NPI-GNN is the first end-to-end GNN predictor for predicting NPIs. All benchmarking datasets in this work and all source codes of the NPI-GNN method have been deposited with documents in a GitHub repo (https://github.com/AshuiRUA/NPI-GNN).},

  abstract = {Giraffe pangenomes                            Genomes within a species often have a core, conserved component, as well as a variable set of genetic material among individuals or populations that is referred to as a ``pangenome.'' Inference of the relationships between pangenomes sequenced with short-read technology is often done computationally by mapping the sequences to a reference genome. The computational method affects genome assembly and comparisons, especially in cases of structural variants that are longer than an average sequenced region, for highly polymorphic loci, and for cross-species analyses. Siren               et al               . present a bioinformatic method called Giraffe, which improves mapping pangenomes in polymorphic regions of the genome containing single nucleotide polymorphisms and structural variants with standard computational resources, making large-scale genomic analyses more accessible. \textemdash LMZ                        ,              A mapping algorithm named Giraffe has been developed to allow mapping of short-read sequences for thousands of genomes.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Modern genomics depends on inexpensive short-read sequencing. Sequenced reads up to a few hundred base pairs in length are computationally mapped to estimated source locations in a reference genome. These read mappings are used in myriad sequencing-based assays. For example, through a process called genotyping, mapped reads from a DNA sample can be used to infer the combination of alleles present at each site in the reference genome.                                         RATIONALE               A single reference genome cannot capture the diversity within even a single person (who gets a genome copy from each parent), let alone in the whole human population. Genomes differ not only by point variations, where one or a few bases are different, but also by structural variations, where differences can be much larger than an individual read. When a person's genome differs from the reference by a structural variation, the reference may contain no location to correctly map the corresponding reads. Although newer long-read sequencing allows structural variation to be more directly observed in sequencing reads, short-read sequencing is still less expensive and more widely available.                                         RESULTS               We present a short read\textendash mapping tool, Giraffe. Giraffe maps to a pangenome reference that describes many genomes and the differences between them. Giraffe can accurately map reads to thousands of genomes embedded in a pangenome reference as quickly as existing tools map to a single reference genome. Simulations in which the true mapping for each read is known show that Giraffe is as accurate as the most accurate previously published tool. Giraffe achieves this speed and accuracy by using a variety of algorithmic techniques. In particular, and in contrast to previous tools, it focuses on mapping to the paths in the pangenome that are observed in individuals' genomes: the reference haplotypes. This has two key benefits. First, it prioritizes alignments that are consistent with known sequences, avoiding combinations of alleles that are biologically unlikely. Second, it reduces the size of the problem by limiting the sequence space to which the reads could be aligned. This deals effectively with complex graph regions where most paths represent rare or nonexistent sequences.               Using Giraffe in place of a single reference genome reduces mapping bias, which is the tendency to incorrectly map reads that differ from the reference genome. Combining Giraffe with state-of-the-art genotyping algorithms demonstrates that Giraffe mappings produce accurate genotyping results.               Using mappings from Giraffe, we genotyped 167,000 recently discovered structural variations in short-read samples for 5202 people at an average computational cost of \$1.50 per sample. We present estimates for the frequency of different versions of these structural variations in the human population as a whole and within individual subpopulations. We identify thousands of these structural variations as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are associated with gene-expression levels.                                         CONCLUSION               Giraffe demonstrates the practicality of a pangenomic approach to short-read mapping. This approach allows short-read data to genotype single-nucleotide variations, short insertions and deletions, and structural variations more accurately. For structural variations, this allowed the estimation of population frequencies across a diverse cohort of 5000 individuals. A single reference genome must choose one version of any variation to represent, leaving the other versions unrepresented. By making more broadly representative pangenome references practical, Giraffe attempts to make genomics more inclusive.                                                   Overview of the experiments.                   Variant calls from long read\textendash based and large-scale sequencing studies were used to construct pangenome reference graphs (top). Giraffe (and competing mappers) mapped reads to the graph or to linear references, and mapping accuracy, allele coverage balance, and speed were evaluated (middle). Then, mapped reads were used for variant calling, and variant call accuracy was evaluated (bottom). Structural variant calls were analyzed alongside expression data to identify eQTLs and population frequency estimates.                                                                         ,              We introduce Giraffe, a pangenome short-read mapper that can efficiently map to a collection of haplotypes threaded through a sequence graph. Giraffe maps sequencing reads to thousands of human genomes at a speed comparable to that of standard methods mapping to a single reference genome. The increased mapping accuracy enables downstream improvements in genome-wide genotyping pipelines for both small variants and larger structural variants. We used Giraffe to genotype 167,000 structural variants, discovered in long-read studies, in 5202 diverse human genomes that were sequenced using short reads. We conclude that pangenomics facilitates a more comprehensive characterization of variation and, as a result, has the potential to improve many genomic analyses.},

  abstract = {Short-tandem repeat (STR) expansions are an important class of pathogenic genetic variants. Over forty neurological and neuromuscular diseases are caused by STR expansions, with 37 different genes implicated to date. Here we describe the use of programmable targeted long-read sequencing with Oxford Nanopore's ReadUntil function for parallel genotyping of all known neuropathogenic STRs in a single, simple assay. Our approach enables accurate, haplotype-resolved assembly and DNA methylation profiling of expanded and nonexpanded STR sites. In doing so, the assay correctly diagnoses all individuals in a cohort of patients (n = 27) with various neurogenetic diseases, including Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome and cerebellar ataxia (CANVAS) and others. Targeted long-read sequencing solves large and complex STR expansions that confound established molecular tests and short-read sequencing, and identifies non-canonical STR motif conformations and internal sequence interruptions. Even in our relatively small cohort, we observe a wide diversity of STR alleles of known and unknown pathogenicity, suggesting that long-read sequencing will redefine the genetic landscape of STR expansion disorders. Finally, we show how the flexible inclusion of pharmacogenomics (PGx) genes as secondary ReadUntil targets can identify clinically actionable PGx genotypes to further inform patient care, at no extra cost. Our study addresses the need for improved techniques for genetic diagnosis of STR expansion disorders and illustrates the broad utility of programmable long-read sequencing for clinical genomics.},

Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development.

The resulting genome sequence, JG1, is contiguous, accurate, and carries the Japanese major allele at most loci. We adopt JG1 as the reference for confirmatory exome re-analyses of seven rare-disease Japanese families and find that re-analysis using JG1 reduces total candidate variant calls versus GRCh37 while retaining disease-causing variants. These results suggest that integrating multiple genomes from a single population can aid genome analyses of that population.},

Advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies, such as high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET), have enabled the exploration of chromatin interaction and organization. However, high-resolution Hi-C and ChIA-PET data are only available for a limited number of cell lines, and their acquisition is costly, time consuming, laborious and affected by theoretical limitations. Increasing evidence shows that DNA sequence and epigenomic features are informative predictors of regulatory interaction and chromatin architecture. Based on these features, numerous computational methods have been developed for the prediction of chromatin interaction and organization, whereas they are not extensively applied in biomedical study. A systematical study to summarize and evaluate such methods is still needed to facilitate their application. Here, we summarize 48 computational methods for the prediction of chromatin interaction and organization using sequence and epigenomic profiles, categorize them and compare their performance. Besides, we provide a comprehensive guideline for the selection of suitable methods to predict chromatin interaction and organization based on available data and biological question of interest.},

The field of conservation genetics aims at preserving species by using their levels of genetic diversity, usually measured as neutral genome-wide diversity, as a barometer for evaluating population health and extinction risk. A fundamental assumption is that higher levels of genetic diversity lead to an increase in fitness and long-term survival of a species. Here, we argue against the perceived importance of neutral genetic diversity for the conservation of wild populations and species. We demonstrate that no simple general relationship exists between neutral genetic diversity and the risk of species extinction. Instead, a better understanding of the properties of functional genetic diversity, demographic history, and ecological relationships is necessary for developing and implementing effective conservation genetic strategies.},

In contrast to classical approaches that emphasize the need for resource-intensive phenotyping at all stages of artificial selection, genomic selection dramatically reduces the need for phenotyping. Genomic selection relies on advances in machine learning and the availability of genotyping data to predict agronomically relevant phenotypic traits. Here we provide a sys\- tematic review of machine learning approaches applied for genomic selection of single and multiple traits in major crops in the past decade. We emphasize the need to gather data on intermediate phenotypes, e.g. metabolite, protein, and gene expression levels, along with developments of modeling techniques that can lead to further improvements of genomic selection. In addition, we provide a critical view of factors that affect genomic selection, with attention to transferability of models between different environments. Finally, we highlight the future aspects of integrating high-throughput molecular phenotypic data from omics technologies with biological networks for crop improvement.},

This revealed waves of gene regulation by key transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites.

  abstract = {Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in gene regulation and phenotype development. The identification of miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) is critical to understand the functional roles of miRNA genes and their transcriptional regulation. Unlike protein-coding genes, miRNA TSSs are not directly detectable from conventional RNA-Seq experiments due to miRNA-specific process of biogenesis. In the past decade, large-scale genome-wide TSS-Seq and transcription activation marker profiling data have become available, based on which, many computational methods have been developed. These methods have greatly advanced genome-wide miRNA TSS annotation. Results: In this study, we summarized recent computational methods and their results on miRNA TSS annotation. We collected and performed a comparative analysis of miRNA TSS annotations from 14 representative studies. We further compiled a robust set of miRNA TSSs (RSmirT) that are supported by multiple studies. Integrative genomic and epigenomic data analysis on RSmirT revealed the genomic and epigenomic features of miRNA TSSs as well as their relations to protein-coding and long non-coding genes.

But most of them hardly take noise effects into account. Data-specific patterns unique to data types also make it challenging to uncover the consistent patterns and learn a compact representation of multi-omics data. Here we present a multi-omics integration method considering these issues. We explicitly model the error term in data reconstruction and simultaneously consider noise effects and data-specific patterns. We utilize a denoised network regularization in which we build a fused network using a denoising procedure to suppress noise effects and data-specific patterns. The error term collaborates with the denoised network regularization to capture data-specific patterns. We solve the optimization problem via an inexact alternating minimization algorithm. A comparative simulation study shows the method's superiority at discovering common patterns among data types at three noise levels. Transcriptomics-and-epigenomics integration, in seven cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas, demonstrates that the learned integrative representation extracted in an unsupervised manner can depict survival information. Specially in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, the learned integrative representation attains average Harrell's C-index of 0.78 in 10 times 3-fold cross-validation for survival prediction, which far exceeds competing methods, and we discover an aggressive subtype in liver hepatocellular carcinoma with this latent representation, which is validated by an external dataset GSE14520. We also show that DeFusion is applicable to the integration of other omics types.},

One tension that has always faced these methods is the trade-off between preservation of global structure and preservation of local structure: these methods can either handle one or the other, but not both. In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the lower-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure. Our work provides several unexpected insights into what design choices both to make and avoid when constructing DR algorithms.},

The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest that vectors several serious plant pathogenic viruses and is an excellent model to probe the molecular mechanisms involved in overcoming plant defenses. Here, we show that, through an exceptional horizontal gene transfer event, the whitefly has acquired the plant-derived phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase gene BtPMaT1. This gene enables whiteflies to neutralize phenolic glucosides. This was confirmed by genetically transforming tomato plants to produce small interfering RNAs that silence BtPMaT1, thus impairing the whiteflies' detoxification ability. These findings reveal an evolutionary scenario whereby herbivores harness the genetic toolkit of their host plants to develop resistance to plant defenses and how this can be exploited for crop protection.},

To comprehensively decipher the genetics of heterosis, we present a new design of multiple linked F1 populations with 42,840 F1 maize hybrids, generated by crossing a synthetic population of 1428 maternal lines with 30 elite testers from diverse genetic backgrounds and phenotyped for agronomic traits. Results: We show that, although yield heterosis is correlated with the widespread, minor-effect epistatic QTLs, it may be resulted from a few major-effect additive and dominant QTLs in early developmental stages. Floral transition is probably one critical stage for heterosis formation, in which epistatic QTLs are activated by paternal contributions of alleles that counteract the recessive, deleterious maternal alleles. These deleterious alleles, while rare, epistatically repress other favorable QTLs. We demonstrate this with one example, showing that Brachytic2 represses the Ubiquitin3 locus in the maternal lines; in hybrids, the paternal allele alleviates this repression, which in turn recovers the height of the plant and enhances the weight of the ear. Finally, we propose a molecular design breeding by manipulating key genes underlying the transition from vegetative-to-reproductive growth. Conclusion: The new population design is used to dissect the genetic basis of heterosis which accelerates maize molecular design breeding by diminishing deleterious epistatic interactions.},

However, the correlated and idiosyncratic pleiotropy phenomena in the human genome will lead to biased estimation of causal effects if they are not properly accounted for. In this article, we develop a novel MR approach named MRCIP to account for correlated and idiosyncratic pleiotropy simultaneously. We first propose a random-effect model to explicitly model the correlated pleiotropy and then propose a novel weighting scheme to handle the presence of idiosyncratic pleiotropy. The model parameters are estimated by maximizing a weighted likelihood function with our proposed PRW-EM algorithm. Moreover, we can also estimate the degree of the correlated pleiotropy and perform a likelihood ratio test for its presence. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed MRCIP has improved performance over competing methods. We also illustrate the usefulness of MRCIP on two real datasets. The R package for MRCIP is publicly available at https://githu b.com/siqixu/MRCIP.},

In this Bayesian framework, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) combined with a PINN for PDEs serves as the prior while the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or the variational inference (VI) could serve as an estimator of the posterior. B-PINNs make use of both physical laws and scattered noisy measurements to provide predictions and quantify the aleatoric uncertainty arising from the noisy data in the Bayesian framework. Compared with PINNs, in addition to uncertainty quantification, B-PINNs obtain more accurate predictions in scenarios with large noise due to their capability of avoiding overfitting. We conduct a systematic comparison between the two different approaches for the B-PINN posterior estimation (i.e., HMC or VI), along with dropout used for quantifying uncertainty in deep neural networks. Our experiments show that HMC is more suitable than VI for the B-PINNs posterior estimation, while dropout employed in PINNs can hardly provide accurate predictions with reasonable uncertainty. Finally, we replace the BNN in the prior with a truncated Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL) expansion combined with HMC or a deep normalizing flow (DNF) model as posterior estimators. The KL is as accurate as BNN and much faster but this framework cannot be easily extended to high-dimensional problems unlike the BNN based framework.},

It is an informative metric to quantify the overall genetic similarity between complex traits, which provides insights into their polygenic genetic architecture. Several methods have been proposed to estimate genetic correlation based on data collected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Due to the easy access of GWAS summary statistics and computational efficiency, methods only requiring GWAS summary statistics as input have become more popular than methods utilizing individual-level genotype data. Here, we present a benchmark study for different summary-statistics-based genetic correlation estimation methods through simulation and real data applications. We focus on two major technical challenges in estimating genetic correlation: marker dependency caused by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sample overlap between different studies. To assess the performance of different methods in the presence of these two challenges, we first conducted comprehensive simulations with diverse LD patterns and sample overlaps. Then we applied these methods to real GWAS summary statistics for a wide spectrum of complex traits. Based on these experiments, we conclude that methods relying on accurate LD estimation are less robust in real data applications due to the imprecision of LD obtained from reference panels. Our findings offer guidance on how to choose appropriate methods for genetic correlation estimation in post-GWAS analysis.},

  abstract = {Irregular splicing was associated with tumor formation and progression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and many other cancers. By using splicing data in the TCGA SpliceSeq database, RCC subtype classification was performed and splicing features and their correlations with clinical course, genetic variants, splicing factors, pathways activation and immune heterogeneity were systemically analyzed. In this research, alternative splicing was found useful for classifying RCC subtypes. Splicing inefficiency with upregulated intron retention and cassette exon was associated with advanced conditions and unfavorable overall survival of patients with RCC. Splicing characteristics like splice site strength, guanine and cytosine content and exon length may be important factors disrupting splicing balance in RCC. Other than cis-acting and trans-acting regulation, alternative splicing also differed in races and tissue types and is also affected by mutation conditions, pathway settings and the response to environmental changes. Severe irregular splicing in tumor not only indicated terrible intra-cellular homeostasis, but also changed the activity of cancer-associated pathways by different splicing effects including isoforms switching and expression regulation. Moreover, irregular splicing and splicing-associated antigens were involved in immune reprograming and formation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Overall, we have described several clinical and molecular features in RCC splicing subtypes, which may be important for patient management and targeting treatment.},

  abstract = {The mixed linear model (MLM) has been widely used in genome-wide association study (GWAS) to dissect quantitative traits in human, animal, and plant genetics. Most methodologies consider all single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects as random effects under the MLM framework, which fail to detect the joint minor effect of multiple genetic markers on a trait. Therefore, polygenes with minor effects remain largely unexplored in today's big data era. In this study, we developed a new algorithm under the MLM framework, which is called the fast multi-locus ridge regression (FastRR) algorithm. The FastRR algorithm first whitens the covariance matrix of the polygenic matrix K and environmental noise, then selects potentially related SNPs among large scale markers, which have a high correlation with the target trait, and finally analyzes the subset variables using a multi-locus deshrinking ridge regression for true quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) detection. Results from the analyses of both simulated and real data show that the FastRR algorithm is more powerful for both large and small QTN detection, more accurate in QTN effect estimation, and has more stable results under various polygenic backgrounds. Moreover, compared with existing methods, the FastRR algorithm has the advantage of high computing speed. In conclusion, the FastRR algorithm provides an alternative algorithm for multi-locus GWAS in high dimensional genomic datasets.},

Various outstanding network reconstruction algorithms use specific assumptions that affect prediction accuracy, in order to deal with the uncertainty of processing.

Furthermore, we discuss several classical, representative and latest methods in each category to analyze core ideas, general steps, characteristics, etc. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art GRN reconstruction technologies on simulated networks and real networks under different scaling conditions. Through standardized performance metrics and common benchmarks, we quantitatively evaluate the stability of various methods and the sensitivity of the same algorithm applying to different scaling networks.

We have developed a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based dexamethasone (Dex) prodrug (i.e., ZSJ-0228) and in a previous study, demonstrated its potential therapeutic efficacy in mice with established LN, while avoiding systemic GC-associated toxicity. In the present study, we have employed a dose-escalation design to establish the optimal dose-response relationships for ZSJ-0228 in treating LN and further investigated the safety of ZSJ-0228 in lupus-prone NZB/W F1 mice with established nephritis. ZSJ-0228 was intravenously (i.v.) administered monthly at four levels: 0.5 (L1), 1.0 (L2), 3.0 (L3), and 8.0 (L4) mg/kg/day Dex equivalent. For controls, mice were treated with i.v. saline every 4 weeks. In addition, a group of mice received intraperitoneal injections (i.p.) of Dex every day or i.v. injections of Dex every four weeks. Treatment of mice with LN with ZSJ-0228 dosed at L1 resulted in the resolution of proteinuria in 14\% of the mice. Mice treated with ZSJ-0228 dosed at L2 and L3 levels resulted in the resolution of proteinuria in {$\sim$}60\% of the mice in both groups. Treatment with ZSJ-0228 dosed at L4 resulted in the resolution of proteinuria in 30\% of the mice. The reduction and/or resolution of the proteinuria, improvement in renal histological scores, and survival data indicate that the most effective dose range for ZSJ-0228 in treating LN in NZB/W F1 mice is between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/day Dex equivalent. Typical GC-associated side effects (e.g., osteopenia, adrenal glands atrophy, etc.) were not observed in any of the ZSJ-0228 treatment groups, confirming its excellent safety profile.},

Further dissecting the association pathways from a variant to multiple traits is important to understand the biological causal relationships among complex traits.

Extensive simulations and real data applications suggest that IMRP has similar or better performance than existing Mendelian Randomization methods for both causal effect estimation and pleiotropic variant detection. The developed pleiotropy test is further extended to detect colocalization for multiple variants at a locus.

The effectiveness of several numerical methods to determine kinetic parameters and the AIF is evaluated\textemdash in situations where enough information about the AIF is not available. The purpose of this study is to identify an appropriate method for estimating this function. Materials and Methods: The modified algorithm is a mixture of the maximum entropy approach with an optimization method, named the teachinglearning method.

We assessed the proficiency of the proposed method for assigning the kinetic parameters in the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), when determining AIF with some other parameter-estimation methods and a standard fixed AIF method. A previously analyzed dataset consisting of contrast agent concentrations in tissue and plasma was used. Results and Conclusions: We compared the accuracy of the results for the estimated parameters obtained from the MMEM with those of the empirical method, maximum likelihood method, moment matching (``method of moments''), the least-square method, the modified maximum likelihood approach, and our previous work. Since the current algorithm does not have the problem of starting point in the parameter estimation phase, it could find the best and nearest model to the empirical model of data, and therefore, the results indicated the Weibull distribution as an appropriate and robust AIF and also illustrated the power and effectiveness of the proposed method to estimate the kinetic parameters.},

In past decades, contributions from combinatorics, stringology, graph theory and data structures were essential in the development of a plethora of software tools for the analysis of the human genome. These tools allowed computational biologists to approach ambitious projects at population scale, such as the 1000 Genomes Project. A major contribution of the 1000 Genomes Project is the characterization of a broad spectrum of genetic variations in the human genome, including the discovery of novel variations in the South Asian, African and European populations\textemdash thus enhancing the catalogue of variability within the reference genome. Currently, the need to take into account the high variability in population genomes as well as the specificity of an individual genome in a personalized approach to medicine is rapidly pushing the abandonment of the traditional paradigm of using a single reference genome. A graph-based representation of multiple genomes, or a graph pangenome, is replacing the linear reference genome. This means completely rethinking well-established procedures to analyze, store, and access information from genome representations. Properly addressing these challenges is crucial to face the computational tasks of ambitious healthcare projects aiming to characterize human diversity by sequencing 1M individuals (Stark et al. 2019). This tutorial aims to introduce readers to the most recent advances in the theory of data structures for the representation of graph pangenomes. We discuss efficient representations of haplotypes and the variability of genotypes in graph pangenomes, and highlight applications in solving computational problems in human and microbial (viral) pangenomes.},

Phospholipids are important metabolites in plant responses to low-temperature and phosphorus availability and have been suggested to influence flowering time. Here, we combined linkage mapping with genome scans to identify               High PhosphatidylCholine 1               (               HPC1               ), a gene that encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme, as a major driver of phospholipid variation in highland maize. Common garden experiments demonstrated strong genotype-by-environment interactions associated with variation at               HPC1,               with the highland               HPC1               allele leading to higher fitness in highlands, possibly by hastening flowering. The highland maize               HPC1               variant resulted in impaired function of the encoded protein due to a polymorphism in a highly conserved sequence. A meta-analysis across HPC1 orthologs indicated a strong association between the identity of the amino acid at this position and optimal growth in prokaryotes. Mutagenesis of               HPC1               via genome editing validated its role in regulating phospholipid metabolism. Finally, we showed that the highland               HPC1               allele entered cultivated maize by introgression from the wild highland teosinte               Zea mays               ssp.               mexicana               and has been maintained in maize breeding lines from the Northern United States, Canada, and Europe.

By making multiple intuitive representations readily available for experimentation, we facilitate rigorous representation robustness checks in graph learning, graph mining, and network analysis, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of specific representations. Leveraging the data released in HYPERBARD, we demonstrate that many solutions to popular graph mining problems are highly dependent on the representation choice, thus calling current graph curation practices into question.

  abstract = {The early biometricians, who attacked Mendelism, morphed into modern population geneticists, who accept Mendelism but maintain that natural selection suffices to explain both within-species evolution ("microevolution") and between-species evolution ("macroevolution"). Among students who came under their influence, were two future historians \textendash{} William Provine and Mark Adams \textendash{} who provided supporting papers and a much-cited text The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics (1971). However, opposition arose from biochemists (e.g., Woese, Pederson), chromosomal cytologists (e.g., White, King), a ciliate geneticist (Nanney), and Richard Grantham, whose bioinformatic analysis of DNA sequences led to his "genome hypothesis" in the 1980s. Drawing on both early studies (Gulick, Romanes, Bateson, Winge, Goldschmidt) and the later works of Chargaff and Sueoka, in the 1990s Grantham's work was continued by a scientist-historian, Forsdyke, who proposed a molecular basis for the initiation of the divergence of one species into two (speciation) that did not require natural selection. Meanwhile, despite their earlier schooling, Provine and Adams had noted anomalies and began to actively question traditional "just-sostories." The convergence of their views with those of Forsdyke, suggested that a "collective variation" postulated by Romanes and a mysterious "residue" postulate by Bateson, might relate to differences in short runs of DNA bases (oligonucleotides). Contrasts are drawn between resolution of scientific conflicts in dictatorships, where specialist groups ("networks") need authoritarian approval, and in democracies, where approval involves public engagement. Whereas the downfall of Nikita Khrushchev quickly reversed Trofim Lysenko's hold on Russian genetics, in the West "public intellectuals" and their followers can slow reform.},

Genomic analyses found that non-B DNA structures at promoters harbor an excess of germline variants. Analysis of multiple MPRAs, including a promoter library specifically designed to perturb non-B DNA structures, functionally validated that Z-DNA can significantly affect promoter activity. We also observed that biophysical properties of non-B DNA motifs, such as the length of Z-DNA motifs and the orientation of G-quadruplex structures relative to transcriptional direction, have a significant effect on promoter activity. Combined, their higher mutation rate and functional effect on transcription implicate a subset of non-B DNA motifs as major drivers of human gene-expressionassociated phenotypes.},

While the effect is small, typically around 2.5\%, it is robust and pervasive. GC skew and the analogous TA skew are a localized deviation from Chargaff's second parity rule, which states that G and C, and T and A occur with (mostly) equal frequency even within a strand. Different bacterial phyla show different kinds of skew, and differing relations between TA and GC skew. This article introduces an open access database (               https://skewdb.org               ) of GC and 10 other skews for over 30,000 chromosomes and plasmids. Further details like codon bias, strand bias, strand lengths and taxonomic data are also included. The               Skew               DB can be used to generate or verify hypotheses.

They show the unique ability to go beyond variant-level genetic-association evidence and implicate critical functional units, e.g., genes, in disease etiology. However, in practice, when the two approaches are applied to the same molecular and complex-trait data, the inference results can be markedly different. This paper systematically investigates the inferential reproducibility between the two approaches through theoretical derivation, numerical experiments, and analyses of four complex trait GWAS and GTEx eQTL data. We identify two classes of inconsistent inference results. We find that the first class of inconsistent results (i.e., genes with strong colocalization but weak transcriptome-wide association study [TWAS] signals) might suggest an interesting biological phenomenon, i.e., horizontal pleiotropy; thus, the two approaches are truly complementary. The inconsistency in the second class (i.e., genes with weak colocalization but strong TWAS signals) can be understood and effectively reconciled. To this end, we propose a computational approach for locus-level colocalization analysis. We demonstrate that the joint TWAS and locus-level colocalization analysis improves specificity and sensitivity for implicating biologically relevant genes.},

However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological human genome since it is a blend of multiple individuals3,4. Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference genome, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a duplicate genome, and is thus nearly homozygous5. To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) recently formed with the goal of creating a collection of high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity6. Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and automated assembly approaches yields the most complete, accurate, and cost-effective diploid genome assemblies with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent-child data to sort haplotypes during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of all the top performing methods, we generated our first highquality diploid reference assembly, containing only \textasciitilde 4 gaps (range 0-12) per chromosome, most within + 1\% of CHM13's length. Nearly 1/4th of protein coding genes have synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest density of variation. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at the scale required for constructing a human pangenome reference that captures all genetic variation from single nucleotides to large structural rearrangements.},

  abstract = {Genetic and omics analyses frequently require independent observations, which is not guaranteed in real datasets. When relatedness cannot be accounted for, solutions involve removing related individuals (or observations) and, consequently, a reduction of available data. We developed a network-based relatedness-pruning method that minimizes dataset reduction while removing unwanted relationships in a dataset. It uses node degree centrality metric to identify highly connected nodes (or individuals) and implements heuristics that approximate the minimal reduction of a dataset to allow its application to complex datasets. When compared with two other popular population genetics methodologies (PLINK and KING), NAToRA shows the best combination of removing all relatives while keeping the largest possible number of individuals in all datasets tested and also, with similar effects on the allele frequency spectrum and Principal Component Analysis than PLINK and KING. NAToRA is freely available, both as a standalone tool that can be easily incorporated as part of a pipeline, and as a graphical web tool that allows visualization of the relatedness networks. NAToRA also accepts a variety of relationship metrics as input, which facilitates its use. We also release a genealogies simulator software used for different tests performed in this study.},

Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generated a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes, reveals novel alleles at structurally complex loci, and adds 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequence and 1,529 gene duplications relative to the existing reference, GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs derive from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyze short-read data reduces errors when discovering small variants by 34\% and boosts the detected structural variants per haplotype by 104\% compared to GRCh38-based workflows, and by 34\% compared to using previous diversity sets of genome assemblies.},

Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model             organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read             sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil-             ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia},

Their giant and complex genomes present great challenges for assembling a complete reference genome for evolutionary and genomic studies. We present a 25.4-Gb chromosome-level assembly of Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) and revealed that its genome size is mostly attributable to huge intergenic regions and long introns with high transposable element (TE) content. Large genes with long introns exhibited higher expressions levels. Despite a lack of recent whole-genome duplication, 91.2\% of genes were duplicated through dispersed duplication, and expanded gene families are mainly related to stress responses, which may underpin conifers' adaptation, particularly in cold and/or arid conditions. The reproductive regulation network is distinct compared with angiosperms. Slow removal of TEs with high-level methylation may have contributed to genomic expansion. This study provides insights into conifer evolution and resources for advancing research on conifer adaptation and development.},

  abstract = {Understanding the inherited nature of how biological processes dynamically change over time and exhibit intra- and inter-individual variability, due to the different responses to environmental stimuli and when interacting with other processes, has been a major focus of systems biology. The rise of single-cell fluorescent microscopy has enabled the study of those phenomena. The analysis of single-cell data with mechanistic models offers an invaluable tool to describe dynamic cellular processes and to rationalise cell-to-cell variability within the population. However, extracting mechanistic information from single-cell data has proven difficult. This requires statistical methods to infer unknown model parameters from dynamic, multi-individual data accounting for heterogeneity caused by both intrinsic (e.g. variations in chemical reactions) and extrinsic (e.g. variability in protein concentrations) noise. Although several inference methods exist, the availability of efficient, general and accessible methods that facilitate modelling of single-cell data, remains lacking. Here we present a scalable and flexible framework for Bayesian inference in state-space mixed-effects single-cell models with stochastic dynamic. Our approach infers model parameters when intrinsic noise is modelled by either exact or approximate stochastic simulators, and when extrinsic noise is modelled by either time-varying, or time-constant parameters that vary between cells. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by studying how cell-to-cell variation in carbon source utilisation affects heterogeneity in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF1 nutrient sensing pathway. We identify hexokinase activity as a source of extrinsic noise and deduce that sugar availability dictates cell-to-cell variability.},

Yet, accurately aligning regulatory and transposon regions outside of genes remains challenging. We introduce Anchored Wavefront alignment (AnchorWave), which implements a genome duplication informed longest path algorithm to identify collinear regions and performs base pair\textendash resolved, end-to-end alignment for collinear blocks using an efficient two-piece affine gap cost strategy. AnchorWave improves the alignment under a number of scenarios: genomes with high similarity, large genomes with high transposable element activity, genomes with many inversions, and alignments between species with deeper evolutionary divergence and different whole-genome duplication histories. Potential use cases include genome comparison for evolutionary analysis of nongenic sequences and population genetics of taxa with large, repeat-rich genomes.           ,              Millions of species are currently being sequenced, and their genomes are being compared. Many of them have more complex genomes than model systems and raise novel challenges for genome alignment. Widely used local alignment strategies often produce limited or incongruous results when applied to genomes with dispersed repeats, long indels, and highly diverse sequences. Moreover, alignment using many-to-many or reciprocal best hit approaches conflicts with well-studied patterns between species with different rounds of whole-genome duplication. Here, we introduce Anchored Wavefront alignment (AnchorWave), which performs whole-genome duplication\textendash informed collinear anchor identification between genomes and performs base pair\textendash resolved global alignment for collinear blocks using a two-piece affine gap cost strategy. This strategy enables AnchorWave to precisely identify multikilobase indels generated by transposable element (TE) presence/absence variants (PAVs). When aligning two maize genomes, AnchorWave successfully recalled 87\% of previously reported TE PAVs. By contrast, other genome alignment tools showed low power for TE PAV recall. AnchorWave precisely aligns up to three times more of the genome as position matches or indels than the closest competitive approach when comparing diverse genomes. Moreover, AnchorWave recalls transcription factor\textendash binding sites at a rate of 1.05- to 74.85-fold higher than other tools with significantly lower false-positive alignments. AnchorWave complements available genome alignment tools by showing obvious improvement when applied to genomes with dispersed repeats, active TEs, high sequence diversity, and whole-genome duplication variation.},

Network and data science offer alternative approaches to classical bioinformatics pipelines to study gene expression patterns from single-cell datasets, helping to distinguish genes associated with the control of differentiation and aggression. To identify the key molecular regulators of the networks driving glioblastoma/GSC and predict their cell fate dynamics, we applied a host of data theoretic techniques to gene expression patterns from pediatric and adult glioblastoma, and adult glioma-derived stem cells (GSCs). We identified eight transcription factors (OLIG1/2, TAZ, GATA2, FOXG1, SOX6, SATB2, and YY1) and four signaling genes (ATL3, MTSS1, EMP1, and TPT1) as coordinators of cell state transitions and, thus, clinically targetable putative factors differentiating pediatric and adult glioblastomas from adult GSCs.

  abstract = {A statistical analysis of important DNA sequences and related proteins has been performed to study the relationships between monomers, and some general considerations about these macromolecules can be provided from the results. First, the most important relationship between sites in all the DNA sequences examined is that between two consecutive base pairs. This is an indication of an energetic stabilization due to the stacking interaction of these couples of base pairs. Secondly, the difference between human chromosome sequences and their coding parts is relevant both in the relationships between sites and in some specific compositional rules, such as the second Chargaff rule. Third, the evidence of the relationship in two successive triplets of DNA coding sequences generates a relationship between two successive amino acids in the proteins. This is obviously impossible if all the relationships between the sites are statistical evidence and do not involve causes; therefore, in this article, due to stacking interactions and this relationship in coding sequences, we will divide the concept of the relationship between sites into two concepts: affinity and correlation, the first with physical causes and the second without. Finally, from the statistical analyses carried out, it will emerge that the human genome is uniform, with the only significant exception being the Y chromosome.},

  abstract = {Biology is data-rich, and it is equally rich in concepts and hypotheses. Part of trying to understand biological processes and systems is therefore to confront our ideas and hypotheses with data using statistical methods to determine the extent to which our hypotheses agree with reality. But doing so in a systematic way is becoming increasingly challenging as our hypotheses become more detailed, and our data becomes more complex. Mathematical methods are therefore gaining in importance across the life- and biomedical sciences. Mathematical models allow us to test our understanding, make testable predictions about future behaviour, and gain insights into how we can control the behaviour of biological systems. It has been argued that mathematical methods can be of great benefit to biologists to make sense of data. But mathematics and mathematicians are set to benefit equally from considering the often bewildering complexity inherent to living systems. Here we present a small selection of open problems and challenges in mathematical biology. We have chosen these open problems because they are of both biological and mathematical interest.},

  abstract = {The subgenus Cerasus and its relatives include many crucial economic drupe fruits and ornamental plants. Repetitive elements make up a large part of complex genomes, and some of them play an important role in gene regulation that can affect phenotypic variation. However, the variation in their genomes remains poorly understood. This work conducted a comprehensive repetitive sequence identification across the draft genomes of eight taxa of the genus Prunus, including four of the Prunus subgenus Cerasus (Prunus pseudocerasus, P. avium, P. yedoensis and P. \texttimes{} yedoensis) as well as congeneric species (Prunus salicina, P. armeniaca, P. dulcis and P. persica). Annotation results showed high proportions of transposable elements in their genomes, ranging from 52.28\% (P. armeniaca) to 61.86\% (P. pseudocerasus). The most notable differences in the contents of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) and tandem repeats (TRs) were confirmed with de novo identification based on the structure of each genome, which significantly contributed to their genome size variation, especially in P. avium and P. salicina. Sequence comparisons showed many similar LTR-RTs closely related to their phylogenetic relationships, and a highly similar monomer unit of the TR sequence was conserved among species. Additionally, the predicted centromere-associated sequence was located in centromeric regions with FISH in the 12 taxa of Prunus. It presented significantly different signal intensities, even within the diverse interindividual phenotypes for Prunus tomentosa. This study provides insight into the LTR-RT and TR variation within Prunus and increases our knowledge about its role in genome evolution.},

Unearthing such an endogenous realm faces challenges due to heterogeneous biology data. This study computes petabyte level data and reveals the endogenous regulatory networks of normal and cancers and then unearths the most important endogenous regulators for normal and cancerous realm. In normal, proteins dominate the entire realm and trans-regulate their targets across chromosomes and ribosomal proteins serve as the most important drivers. However, in cancerous realm, noncoding RNAs dominate the whole realm and pseudogenes work as the most important regulators that cis-regulate their neighbors, in which they primarily regulate their targets within 1 million base pairs but they rarely regulate their cognates with complementary sequences as thought. Therefore, two distinctive mechanisms rule the normal and cancerous realm separately, in which noncoding RNAs endogenously regulate cancers, instead of proteins as currently conceptualized. This establishes a fundamental avenue to understand the basis of cancerous and normal physiology.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Unilateral cross incompatibility (UCI) occurs between popcorn and dent corn, and represents a critical step towards speciation. It has been reported that               ZmGa1P               , encoding a pectin methylesterase (               PME               ), is a male determinant of the               Ga1               locus. However, the female determinant and the genetic relationship between male and female determinants at this locus are unclear. Here, we report three different types, a total of seven linked genes underlying the               Ga1               locus, which control UCI phenotype by independently affecting pollen tube growth in both antagonistic and synergistic manners. These include five pollen-expressed               PME               genes (               ZmGa1Ps-m               ), a silk-expressed PME gene (               ZmPME3               ), and another silk-expressed gene (               ZmPRP3               ), encoding a pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins.               ZmGa1Ps-m               confer pollen compatibility. Presence of               ZmPME3               causes silk to reject incompatible pollen.               ZmPRP3               promotes incompatibility pollen tube growth and thereby breaks the blocking effect of               ZmPME3               . In addition, evolutionary genomics analyses suggest that the divergence of the               Ga1               locus existed before maize domestication and continued during breeding improvement. The knowledge gained here deepen our understanding of the complex regulation of cross incompatibility.},

  abstract = {Modern sequencing technologies are not error-free, and might possess systematic biases in their error distributions. A potential cause for non-randomly occurring errors is the formation of alternative DNA structures (non-B DNA), such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), Z-DNA, or cruciform structures, during sequencing. Approximately 13\% of the human genome has the potential to form such structures, which have been previously shown to affect the speed and accuracy of DNA polymerases. To test whether motifs with the potential to form non-B DNA (non-B motifs) influence sequencing success, we studied three major sequencing technologies (Illumina, Pacific Biosciences HiFi, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT). We estimated sequencing success by computing the rates of single-nucleotide, insertion, and deletion errors, as well as by evaluating mean read depth and mean base quality. Overall, all technologies exhibited altered sequencing success for most non-B motif types. Single-nucleotide error rates were generally increased for G-quadruplexes (G4s) and Z-DNA motifs in all three technologies. Illumina and PacBio HiFi deletion error rates were also increased for all non-B types except for Z-DNA motifs, while in ONT they were increased for all non-B types except for G4 motifs. Insertion error rates for non-B motifs were highly elevated in Illumina, moderately elevated in PacBio HiFi, and only slightly elevated in ONT. Using Poisson regression modeling, we evaluated how non-B DNA and other factors influence sequencing error profiles. Overall, the effect of non-B DNA on sequencing should be considered in downstream analyses, particularly in studies with limited read depth\textemdash e.g., single-cell and ancient DNA sequencing, as well as sequencing of pooled population samples. Because of different error profiles, a combination of technologies should be considered in sequencing studies of non-B motifs.},

Standard techniques for profiling RBP targets, such as crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and its variants, are limited or suboptimal in some situations, e.g. when compatible antibodies are not available and when dealing with small cell populations such as neuronal subtypes and primary stem cells. This review summarizes and compares several genetic approaches recently designed to identify RBP targets in such circumstances. TRIBE (targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing), RNA tagging, and STAMP (surveying targets by APOBEC-mediated profiling) are new genetic tools useful for the study of post-transcriptional regulation and RBP identification. We describe the underlying RNA base editing technology, recent applications, and therapeutic implications.},

Here, we develop a pipeline to accurately identify 2,398 small microexons in 10 diverse plant species using 990 RNA-seq datasets, and most of them have not been annotated in the reference genomes. Analysis reveals that microexons tend to have increased detained flanking introns that require post-transcriptional splicing after polyadenylation. Examination of 45 conserved microexon clusters demonstrates that microexons and associated gene structures can be traced back to the origin of land plants. Based on these clusters, we develop an algorithm to genome-wide model coding microexons in 132 plants and find that microexons provide a strong phylogenetic signal for plant organismal relationships. Microexon modeling reveals diverse evolutionary trajectories, involving microexon gain and loss and alternative splicing. Our work provides a comprehensive view of microexons in plants.},

The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions               3,4               . Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19\,million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24\% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.},
