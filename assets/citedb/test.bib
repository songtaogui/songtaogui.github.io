  abstract = {The breeding system in Nicotiana glauca is unique in that the species comprises mainly self-compatible (S.C.) green-flowered plants but also includes rare self-incompatible (S.I.) red-flowered races. The S.C. plants of Nicotiana glauca show unilateral interspecificincompatibility with other S.I. species of Nicotiana, a widely occurring characteristic normally associated with S.C. species with relatively long-established self-compatibility. The present study of S.I. and S.C. strains of Nicotiana glauca showed that the \$ S.I. x S.C. S type of unilateral incompatibility (U.I.) occurs within this species, and the U.I. is a function of the S alleles. Of the nine S, alleles studied seven, when present in the homozygous state in the style, made that style reject Sc (Nicotiana glauca) pollen whereas two alleles allowed styles to accept this pollen. Similar polymorphism at the Nicotiana glauca S locus was also found in relation to Sf pollen from the S.C. species Nicotiana langsdorffiiS. , alleles in Nicotiana glauca were classified differentlyfor the polymorphisms in relation to Sc and Sf pollen. The results show that the Sc allele is sporophytically determined causing allelic interaction in the pollen and style. Dominance, co-dominance and competitive interaction were observed. In contrast the Sf allele of Nicotiana langsdorffiis gametophytically determined, stylar alleles always showing independent action.},

  abstract = {Highly purified fractions of three starch branching enzymes from developing maize (Zea mays L) endosperm were used to prepare antisera in rabbits. In double diffusion experiments, no immunoprecipitate was observed when branching enzyme IIa or Ilb was tested against branching enzyme I antiserum. No immunoprecipitate was formed when branching enzyme I was tested against branching enzyme Ila or lib antisenum. Increasing amounts of antisera in the above combinations also failed to inhibit enzyme activity. Branching enzyme IIa antiserum cross-reacted and formed spurs with branching enzyme lIb when compared with branching enzyme hIa antigen. Comparison of branching enzyme IIb antiserum with branching enzyme Ila also resulted in an immunoprecipitate. Increasing levels of branching enzyme IIa antiserum inhibited branching enzyme Ilb as did the reciprocal combination. The data indicated that branching enzymes Ila and Ilb are immunologically similar while branching enzyme I is distinct. The data supports the classification of starch branching enzymes based on genetic, kinetic, and chromatographic properties.},

  abstract = {Aquatic plants are notoriously difficult to study systematically due to convergent evolution and reductionary processes that result in confusing arrays of morphological features. Plant systematists have frequently focused their attention on the "water lilies," putative descendants of the most archaic angiosperms. Classification of these 10 plant genera varies from recognition of one to three orders containing three to six families. We have used DNA sequence analysis as a means of overcoming many problems inherent in morphologically based studies of the group. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data obtained from a 1.2-kilobase portion of the chloroplast gene rbcL provide compelling evidence for the recognition of three distinct lineages of "water lily" plants. Molecular phylogenies including woody Magnoliidae sequences and sequences of these aquatic plants depict Ceratophyllum as an early diverging genus. Our results support hypotheses that most taxonomic concepts of the order Nymphaeales reflect polyphyletic groups and that the unusual genus Ceratophyllum represents descendants of some of the earliest angiosperms.},

  abstract = {The maize gene rab28 has been identified as ABA-inducible in embryos and vegetative tissues. It is also induced by water stress in young leaves. The proximal promoter region contains the conserved cis-acting element CCACGTGG (ABRE) reported for ABA induction in other plant genes. Transient expression assays in rice protoplasts indicate that a 134 bp fragment ( - 194 to -60 containing the ABRE) fused to a truncated cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (35S) is sufficient to confer ABA-responsiveness upon the GUS reporter gene. Gel retardation experiments indicate that nuclear proteins from tissues in which the rab28 gene is expressed can interact specifically with this 134 bp DNA fragment. Nuclear protein extracts from embryo and water-stressed leaves generate specific complexes of different electrophoretic mobility which are stable in the presence of detergent and high salt. However, by DMS footprinting the same guanine-specific contacts with the ABRE in both the embryo and leaf binding activities were detected. These results indicate that the rab28 promoter sequence CCACGTGG is a functional ABAresponsive element, and suggest that distinct regulatory factors with apparent similar affinity for the ABRE sequence may be involved in the hormone action during embryo development and in vegetative tissues subjected to osmotic stress.},
