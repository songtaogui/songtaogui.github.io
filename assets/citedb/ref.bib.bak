	abstract = {Alternative splicing, a mechanism of post-transcriptional RNA processing whereby a single gene can encode multiple distinct transcripts, has been proposed to underlie morphological innovations in multicellular organisms. Genes with developmental functions are enriched for alternative splicing events, suggestive of a contribution of alternative splicing to developmental programmes. The role of alternative splicing as a source of transcript diversification has previously been compared to that of gene duplication, with the relationship between the two extensively explored. Alternative splicing is reduced following gene duplication with the retention of duplicate copies higher for genes which were alternatively spliced prior to duplication. Furthermore, and unlike the case for overall gene number, the proportion of alternatively spliced genes has also increased in line with the evolutionary diversification of cell types, suggesting alternative splicing may contribute to the complexity of developmental programmes. Together these observations suggest a prominent role for alternative splicing as a source of functional innovation. However, it is unknown whether the proliferation of alternative splicing events indeed reflects a functional expansion of the transcriptome or instead results from weaker selection acting on larger species, which tend to have a higher number of cell types and lower population sizes.

            Previous transcriptomic profiling studies have typically focused on separately analyzing mRNA expression, alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation differences between cell and tissue types. However, the relative contribution of these three transcriptomic regulatory layers to cell type specification is poorly understood. This question is particularly relevant to neurons, given their extensive heterogeneity associated with brain location, morphology and function. In the present study, we generated profiles for the three regulatory layers from developmentally and regionally distinct subpopulations of neurons from the mouse hippocampus and broader nervous system. Multi-omics factor analyses revealed differing contributions of each transcriptomic layer in the discrimination of neurons based on their stage of development, region, and function. Importantly, profiles of differential alternative splicing and polyadenylation better discriminated specific neuronal subtype populations than gene expression patterns. These results provide evidence for differential relative contributions of coordinated gene regulatory layers in the specification of neuronal subtypes.},

	abstract = {Background: Microexons, exons that are ≤ 30 nucleotides, are a highly conserved and dynamically regulated set of cassette exons. They have key roles in nervous system development and function, as evidenced by recent results demonstrating the impact of microexons on behaviour and cognition. However, microexons are often overlooked due to the difficulty of detecting them using standard RNA-seq aligners.
Results: Here, we present MicroExonator, a novel pipeline for reproducible de novo discovery and quantification of microexons. We process 289 RNA-seq datasets from eighteen mouse tissues corresponding to nine embryonic and postnatal stages, providing the most comprehensive survey of microexons available for mice. We detect 2984 microexons, 332 of which are differentially spliced throughout mouse embryonic brain development, including 29 that are not present in mouse transcript annotation databases. Unsupervised clustering of microexons based on their inclusion patterns segregates brain tissues by developmental time, and further analysis suggests a key function for microexons in axon growth and synapse formation. Finally, we analyse single-cell RNA-seq data from the mouse visual cortex, and for the first time, we report differential inclusion between neuronal subpopulations, suggesting that some microexons could be cell type-specific.
Conclusions: MicroExonator facilitates the investigation of microexons in transcriptome studies, particularly when analysing large volumes of data. As a proof of principle, we use MicroExonator to analyse a large collection of both mouse bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets. The analyses enabled the discovery of previously uncharacterized microexons, and our study provides a comprehensive microexon inclusion catalogue during mouse development.},

            It is challenging to identify the smallest microexons (≤15-nt) due to their small size. Consequently, these microexons are often misannotated or missed entirely during genome annotation. Here, we develop a pipeline to accurately identify 2,398 small microexons in 10 diverse plant species using 990 RNA-seq datasets, and most of them have not been annotated in the reference genomes. Analysis reveals that microexons tend to have increased detained flanking introns that require post-transcriptional splicing after polyadenylation. Examination of 45 conserved microexon clusters demonstrates that microexons and associated gene structures can be traced back to the origin of land plants. Based on these clusters, we develop an algorithm to genome-wide model coding microexons in 132 plants and find that microexons provide a strong phylogenetic signal for plant organismal relationships. Microexon modeling reveals diverse evolutionary trajectories, involving microexon gain and loss and alternative splicing. Our work provides a comprehensive view of microexons in plants.},

              Alternative DNA structure-forming sequences can stimulate mutagenesis and are enriched at mutation hotspots in human cancer genomes, implicating them in disease etiology. However, the mechanisms involved are not well characterized. Here, we discover that Z-DNA is mutagenic in yeast as well as human cells, and that the nucleotide excision repair complex, Rad10-Rad1(ERCC1-XPF), and the mismatch repair complex, Msh2-Msh3, are required for Z-DNA-induced genetic instability in yeast and human cells. Both ERCC1-XPF and MSH2-MSH3 bind to Z-DNA-forming sequences, though ERCC1-XPF recruitment to Z-DNA is dependent on MSH2-MSH3. Moreover, ERCC1-XPF

              dependent DNA strand-breaks occur near the Z-DNA-forming region in human cell extracts, and we model these interactions at the sub-molecular level.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Computational methods to predict Z-DNA regions are in high demand to understand the functional role of Z-DNA. The previous state-of-the-art method Z-Hunt is based on statistical mechanical and energy considerations about B- to Z-DNA transition using sequence information. Z-DNA CHiP-seq experiment results showed little overlap with Z-Hunt predictions implying that sequence information only is not sufficient to explain emergence of Z-DNA at different genomic locations. Adding epigenetic and other functional genomic mark-ups to DNA sequence level can help revealing the functional Z-DNA sites. Here we take advantage of the deep learning approach that can analyze and extract information from large volumes of molecular biology data. We developed a machine learning approach DeepZ that aggregates information from genome-wide maps of epigenetic markers, transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding sites, and chromosome accessibility maps. With the developed model we not only verify the experimental Z-DNA predictions, but also generate the whole-genome annotation, introducing new possible Z-DNA regions, which have not yet been found in experiments and can be of interest to the researchers from various fields.},

            Approximately 13\% of the human genome can fold into non-canonical (non-B) DNA structures (e.g. G-quadruplexes, Z-DNA, etc.), which have been implicated in vital cellular processes. Non-B DNA also hinders replication, increasing errors and facilitating mutagenesis, yet its contribution to genome-wide variation in mutation rates remains unexplored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of nucleotide substitution frequencies at non-B DNA loci within noncoding, non-repetitive genome regions, their ±2 kb flanking regions, and 1-Megabase windows, using human-orangutan divergence and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Functional data analysis at single-base resolution demonstrated that substitution frequencies are usually elevated at non-B DNA, with patterns specific to each non-B DNA type. Mirror, direct and inverted repeats have higher substitution frequencies in spacers than in repeat arms, whereas G-quadruplexes, particularly stable ones, have higher substitution frequencies in loops than in stems. Several non-B DNA types also affect substitution frequencies in their flanking regions. Finally, non-B DNA explains more variation than any other predictor in multiple regression models for diversity or divergence at 1-Megabase scale. Thus, non-B DNA substantially contributes to variation in substitution frequencies at small and large scales. Our results highlight the role of non-B DNA in germline mutagenesis with implications to evolution and genetic diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Short tandem repeats (STRs) are important polymorphism makers for human identification and kinship analyses in forensic science. With the continuous development of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), more laboratories have utilized this technology for forensic applications. Existing STR genotyping tools, mostly developed for whole-genome sequencing data, are not effective for MPS data. More importantly, their backward compatibility with the conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE) technology has not been evaluated and guaranteed.
Results: In this study, we developed a new end-to-end pipeline called STRsearch for STR-MPS data analysis. The STRsearch can not only determine the allele by counting repeat patterns and INDELs that are actually in the STR region, but it also translates MPS results into standard STR nomenclature (numbers and letters). We evaluated the performance of STRsearch in two forensic sequencing datasets, and the concordance with CE genotypes was 75.73 and 75.75\%, increasing 12.32 and 9.05\% than the existing tool named STRScan, respectively. Additionally, we trained a base classifier using sequence properties and used it to predict the probability of correct genotyping at a given locus, resulting in the highest accuracy of 96.13\%.
Conclusions: All these results demonstrated that STRsearch was a better tool to protect the backward compatibility with CE for the targeted STR profiling in MPS data. STRsearch is available as open-source software at https://github. com/AnJingwd/STRsearch.},

              , genotyping 2046 STR loci each, using highly parallel STR sequencing with molecular inversion probes. We found that 95\% of examined STRs are polymorphic, with a median of six alleles per STR across these strains. STR expansions (large copy number increases) are found in most strains, several of which have evident functional effects. These include three of six intronic STR expansions we found to be associated with intron retention. Coding STRs were depleted of variation relative to noncoding STRs, and we detected a total of 56 coding STRs (11\%) showing low variation consistent with the action of purifying selection. In contrast, some STRs show hypervariable patterns consistent with diversifying selection. Finally, we detected 133 novel STR-phenotype associations under stringent criteria, most of which could not be detected with SNPs alone, and validated some with follow-up experiments. Our results support the conclusion that STRs constitute a large, unascertained reservoir of functionally relevant genomic variation.},

	abstract = {Significance
            We generated genomic data to estimate the population history of grapes, the most economically important horticultural crop in the world. Domesticated grapes experienced a protracted, 22,000-y population decline prior to domestication; we hypothesize that this decline reflects low-intensity cultivation by humans prior to domestication. Domestication altered the mating system of grapes. The sex determination region is detectable as a region of heightened genetic divergence between wild and cultivated accessions. Based on gene expression analyses, we propose candidate genes that alter sex determination. Finally, grapes contain more deleterious mutations in heterozygous states than do their wild ancestors. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is due in part to clonal propagation, which shelters deleterious recessive mutations.
          , 
            
              We gathered genomic data from grapes (
              Vitis vinifera
              ssp.
              vinifera
              ), a clonally propagated perennial crop, to address three ongoing mysteries about plant domestication. The first is the duration of domestication; archaeological evidence suggests that domestication occurs over millennia, but genetic evidence indicates that it can occur rapidly. We estimated that our wild and cultivated grape samples diverged ∼22,000 years ago and that the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size (
              N
              
                e
              
              ) thereafter. The long decline may reflect low-intensity management by humans before domestication. The second mystery is the identification of genes that contribute to domestication phenotypes. In cultivated grapes, we identified candidate-selected genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development, and stress responses. In contrast, candidate-selected genes in the wild sample were limited to abiotic and biotic stress responses. A genomic region of high divergence corresponded to the sex determination region and included a candidate male sterility factor and additional genes with sex-specific expression. The third mystery concerns the cost of domestication. Annual crops accumulate putatively deleterious variants, in part due to strong domestication bottlenecks. The domestication of perennial crops differs from that of annuals in several ways, including the intensity of bottlenecks, and it is not yet clear if they accumulate deleterious variants. We found that grape accessions contained 5.2\% more deleterious variants than wild individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state. Using forward simulations, we confirm that clonal propagation leads to the accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations but without decreasing fitness.},

              Local adaptation can occur due to individual genetic variants that increase the fitness of individuals in their home environments but decrease fitness in other environments [genetic trade-offs (GTs)] or genetic variants that increase fitness in one environment but have no effect in other environments [conditional neutrality (CN)]. Here, we show that GT quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fitness between Italian and Swedish
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              exhibit strong population genomic signatures of local adaptation, including elevated levels of allele frequency differentiation, correlations to climatic variables, and recent sweeps. Highly divergent genes between Italy and Sweden populations show evidence of more recent selection in Sweden than Italy, and the biological annotations of these genes suggest interesting mechanisms underlying local adaptation.

              Evidence for adaptation to different climates in the model species
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              is seen in reciprocal transplant experiments, but the genetic basis of this adaptation remains poorly understood. Field-based quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies provide direct but low-resolution evidence for the genetic basis of local adaptation. Using high-resolution population genomic approaches, we examine local adaptation along previously identified genetic trade-off (GT) and conditionally neutral (CN) QTLs for fitness between locally adapted Italian and Swedish
              A. thaliana
              populations [Ågren J, et al. (2013)
              Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
              110:21077–21082]. We find that genomic regions enriched in high

                ST

              regions also colocalize with regions enriched for SNPs significantly correlated to climate in Eurasia and evidence of recent selective sweeps in Sweden. Examining unfolded site frequency spectra across genes containing high

                ST
              
              SNPs suggests GTs may be due to more recent adaptation in Sweden than Italy. Finally, we collapse a list of thousands of genes spanning GT QTLs to 42 genes that likely underlie the observed GTs and explore potential biological processes driving these trade-offs, from protein phosphorylation, to seed dormancy and longevity. Our analyses link population genomic analyses and field-based QTL studies of local adaptation, and emphasize that GTs play an important role in the process of local adaptation.},

	abstract = {Background: Waterlily (Nymphaea spp.), a perennial herbaceous aquatic plant, is divided into two ecological groups: hardy waterlily and tropical waterlily. Although the hardy waterlily has no attractive blue flower cultivar, its adaptability is stronger than tropical waterlily because it can survive a cold winter. Thus, breeding hardy waterlily with real blue flowers has become an important target for breeders. Molecular breeding may be a useful way. However, molecular studies on waterlily are limited due to the lack of sequence data.
Results: In this study, six cDNA libraries generated from the petals of two different coloring stages of blue tropical waterlily cultivar Nymphaea ‘King of Siam’ were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq™ 2500 platform. Each library produced no less than 5.65 Gb clean reads. Subsequently, de novo assembly generated 112,485 unigenes, including 26,206 unigenes annotated to seven public protein databases. Then, 127 unigenes could be identified as putative homologues of color-related genes in other species, including 28 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated unigenes. In petals, 16 flavonoids (4 anthocyanins and 12 flavonols) were detected in different contents during the color development due to the different expression levels of color-related genes, and four flavonols were detected in waterlily for the first time. Furthermore, UA3GTs were selected as the most important candidates involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway, UA3GTs induced blue petal color formation in Nymphaea ‘King of Siam’.
Conclusions: This study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of blue flowers in waterlily and provide the basis for molecular breeding of blue hardy waterlily cultivars.},

              Epistatic interactions between mutations can make evolutionary trajectories contingent on the chance occurrence of initial mutations. We used experimental evolution in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              to quantify this contingency, finding differences in adaptability among 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic.},

	abstract = {Background: Reproductive division of labor in eusocial insects is a striking example of a shared genetic background giving rise to alternative phenotypes, namely queen and worker castes. Queen and worker phenotypes play major roles in the evolution of eusocial insects. Their behavior, morphology and physiology underpin many ecologically relevant colony-level traits, which evolved in parallel in multiple species.
Results: Using queen and worker transcriptomic data from 16 ant species we tested the hypothesis that conserved sets of genes are involved in ant reproductive division of labor. We further hypothesized that such sets of genes should also be involved in the parallel evolution of other key traits. We applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis, which clusters co-expressed genes into modules, whose expression levels can be summarized by their ‘eigengenes’. Eigengenes of most modules were correlated with phenotypic differentiation between queens and workers. Furthermore, eigengenes of some modules were correlated with repeated evolution of key phenotypes such as complete worker sterility, the number of queens per colony, and even invasiveness. Finally, connectivity and expression levels of genes within the co-expressed network were strongly associated with the strength of selection. Although caste-associated sets of genes evolve faster than non-caste-associated, we found no evidence for queen- or worker-associated co-expressed genes evolving faster than one another.
Conclusions: These results identify conserved functionally important genomic units that likely serve as building blocks of phenotypic innovation, and allow the remarkable breadth of parallel evolution seen in ants, and possibly other eusocial insects as well.},

              The giant panda and red panda are obligate bamboo-feeders that independently evolved from meat-eating ancestors and possess adaptive pseudothumbs, making them ideal models for studying convergent evolution. In this study, we identified genomic signatures of convergent evolution associated with bamboo eating. Comparative genomic analyses revealed adaptively convergent genes potentially involved with pseudothumb development and essential bamboo nutrient utilization. We also found that the umami taste receptor gene
              TAS1R1
              has been pseudogenized in both pandas. These findings provide insights into genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic convergence and adaptation to a specialized bamboo diet in both pandas and offer an example of genome-scale analyses for detecting convergent evolution.

              Phenotypic convergence between distantly related taxa often mirrors adaptation to similar selective pressures and may be driven by genetic convergence. The giant panda (
              Ailuropoda melanoleuca
              ) and red panda (
              Ailurus fulgens
              ) belong to different families in the order Carnivora, but both have evolved a specialized bamboo diet and adaptive pseudothumb, representing a classic model of convergent evolution. However, the genetic bases of these morphological and physiological convergences remain unknown. Through de novo sequencing the red panda genome and improving the giant panda genome assembly with added data, we identified genomic signatures of convergent evolution. Limb development genes
              DYNC2H1
              and
              PCNT
              have undergone adaptive convergence and may be important candidate genes for pseudothumb development. As evolutionary responses to a bamboo diet, adaptive convergence has occurred in genes involved in the digestion and utilization of bamboo nutrients such as essential amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins. Similarly, the umami taste receptor gene
              TAS1R1
              has been pseudogenized in both pandas. These findings offer insights into genetic convergence mechanisms underlying phenotypic convergence and adaptation to a specialized bamboo diet.},

	abstract = {Background: Worldwide feralization of crop species into agricultural weeds threatens global food security. Weedy rice is a feral form of rice that infests paddies worldwide and aggressively outcompetes cultivated varieties. Despite increasing attention in recent years, a comprehensive understanding of the origins of weedy crop relatives and how a universal feralization process acts at the genomic and molecular level to allow the rapid adaptation to weediness are still yet to be explored.
Results: We use whole-genome sequencing to examine the origin and adaptation of 524 global weedy rice samples representing all major regions of rice cultivation. Weed populations have evolved multiple times from cultivated rice, and a strikingly high proportion of contemporary Asian weed strains can be traced to a few Green Revolution cultivars that were widely grown in the late twentieth century. Latin American weedy rice stands out in having originated through extensive hybridization. Selection scans indicate that most genomic regions underlying weedy adaptations do not overlap with domestication targets of selection, suggesting that feralization occurs largely through changes at loci unrelated to domestication.
Conclusions: This is the first investigation to provide detailed genomic characterizations of weedy rice on a global scale, and the results reveal diverse genetic mechanisms underlying worldwide convergent rice feralization.},

If only a limited subset of possible mutations is fixed in independent lineages, then it is clear that constraint in the production or function of molecular variants is an important determinant of adaptation. We demonstrate remarkably constrained convergence during the evolution of resistance to the lethal poison, tetrodotoxin, in six snake species representing three distinct lineages from around the globe. Resistance-conferring amino acid substitutions in a voltage-gated sodium channel, Na
              v

              1.4 resistance to tetrodotoxin. These results suggest that constraints resulting from functional tradeoffs between ion channel function and toxin resistance led to predictable patterns of evolutionary convergence at the molecular level. Our data are consistent with theoretical predictions and recent microcosm work that suggest a predictable path is followed during an adaptive walk along a mutational landscape, and that natural selection may be frequently constrained to produce similar genetic outcomes even when operating on independent lineages.},

              The Apocynaceae plant family produces toxic cardenolids. However, many insects have managed to escape the deleterious effects of these chemicals and even, in some cases, use them in their own defense.

              Numerous insects have independently evolved the ability to feed on plants that produce toxic secondary compounds called cardenolides and can sequester these compounds for use in their defense. We surveyed the protein target for cardenolides, the alpha subunit of the sodium pump, Na

Despite the large number of potential targets for modulating cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions associated with host-plant specialization are highly clustered, with many parallel substitutions. Additionally, we document four independent duplications of ATPα with convergent tissue-specific expression patterns. We find that unique substitutions are disproportionately associated with recent duplications relative to parallel substitutions. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that adaptation tends to take evolutionary paths that minimize negative pleiotropy.},

	abstract = {John Maynard Smith compared protein evolution to the game where one word is converted into another a single letter at a time, with the constraint that all intermediates are words: WORD→WORE→GORE→GONE→GENE. In this analogy, epistasis constrains evolution, with some mutations tolerated only after the occurrence of others. To test whether epistasis similarly constrains actual protein evolution, we created all intermediates along a 39-mutation evolutionary trajectory of influenza nucleoprotein, and also introduced each mutation individually into the parent. Several mutations were deleterious to the parent despite becoming fixed during evolution without negative impact. These mutations were destabilizing, and were preceded or accompanied by stabilizing mutations that alleviated their adverse effects. The constrained mutations occurred at sites enriched in T-cell epitopes, suggesting they promote viral immune escape. Our results paint a coherent portrait of epistasis during nucleoprotein evolution, with stabilizing mutations permitting otherwise inaccessible destabilizing mutations which are sometimes of adaptive value.
          , 
            During evolution, the effect of one mutation on a protein can depend on whether another mutation is also present. This phenomenon is similar to the game in which one word is converted to another word, one letter at a time, subject to the rule that all the intermediate steps are also valid words: for example, the word WORD can be converted to the word GENE as follows: WORD→WORE→GORE→GONE→GENE. In this example, the D must be changed to an E before the W is changed to a G, because GORD is not a valid word.
            Similarly, during the evolution of a virus, a mutation that helps the virus evade the human immune system might only be tolerated if the virus has acquired another mutation beforehand. This type of mutational interaction would constrain the evolution of the virus, since its capacity to take advantage of the second mutation depends on the first mutation having already occurred.
            Gong et al. examined whether such interactions have indeed constrained evolution of the influenza virus. Between 1968 and 2007, the nucleoprotein—which acts as a scaffold for the replication of genetic material—in the human H3N2 influenza virus underwent a series of 39 mutations. To test whether all of these mutations could have been tolerated by the 1968 virus, Gong et al. introduced each one individually into the 1968 nucleoprotein. They found that several mutations greatly reduced the fitness of the 1968 virus when introduced on their own, which strongly suggests that these ‘constrained mutations’ became part of the virus’s genetic makeup as a result of interactions with ‘enabling’ mutations.
            The constrained mutations decreased the stability of the nucleoprotein at high temperatures, while the enabling mutations counteracted this effect. It may, therefore, be possible to identify enabling mutations based on their effects on thermal stability. Intriguingly, the constrained mutations helped the virus overcome one form of human immunity to influenza, suggesting that interactions between mutations might limit the rate at which viruses evolve to evade the immune system.
            Overall, these results show that interactions among mutations constrain the evolution of the influenza nucleoprotein in a fashion that can be largely understood in terms of protein stability. If the same is true for other proteins and viruses, this work could lead to a deeper understanding of the constraints that govern evolution at the molecular level.},

              analyzed the genome of the electric eel and the genes expressed in two other distantly related electric fish. The same genes were recruited within the different species to make evolutionarily new structures that function similarly.

              Little is known about the genetic basis of convergent traits that originate repeatedly over broad taxonomic scales. The myogenic electric organ has evolved six times in fishes to produce electric fields used in communication, navigation, predation, or defense. We have examined the genomic basis of the convergent anatomical and physiological origins of these organs by assembling the genome of the electric eel (
              Electrophorus electricus
              ) and sequencing electric organ and skeletal muscle transcriptomes from three lineages that have independently evolved electric organs. Our results indicate that, despite millions of years of evolution and large differences in the morphology of electric organ cells, independent lineages have leveraged similar transcription factors and developmental and cellular pathways in the evolution of electric organs.},

	abstract = {Background: Parasitic plants rely on their host to cover their nutritional requirements either for their entire life or a smaller part of it. Depending on the level of parasitism, a proportional reduction on the plastid genome has been found. However, knowledge on gene loss and evolution of the mitogenome of parasitic plants is only available for four hemiparasitic Viscum species (Viscaceae), which lack many of the mitochondrial genes, while the remaining genes exhibit very fast molecular evolution rates. In this study, we include another genus, Phoradendron, from the Viscaceae, as well as 10 other hemiparasitic or holoparasitic taxa from across the phylogeny of the angiosperms to investigate how fast molecular evolution works on their mitogenomes, and the extent of gene loss.
Results: Our observations from Viscum were replicated in Phoradendron liga, whereas the remaining parasitic plants in the study have a complete set of the core mitochondrial genes and exhibit moderate or only slightly raised substitution rates compared to most autotrophic taxa, without any statistically significant difference between the different groups (autotrophs, hemiparasites and holoparasites). Additionally, further evidence is provided for the placement of Balanophoraceae within the order Santalales, while the exact placement of Cynomoriaceae still remains elusive.
Conclusions: We examine the mitochondrial gene content of 11 hemiparasitic and holoparasitic plants and confirm previous observations in Viscaceae. We show that the remaining parasitic plants do not have significantly higher substitution rates than autotrophic plants in their mitochondrial genes. We provide further evidence for the placement of Balanophoraceae in the Santalales.},

	abstract = {Background: Genotype networks are representations of genetic variation data that are complementary to phylogenetic trees. A genotype network is a graph whose nodes are genotypes (DNA sequences) with the same broadly defined phenotype. Two nodes are connected if they differ in some minimal way, e.g., in a single nucleotide.
Results: We analyze human genome variation data from the 1,000 genomes project, and construct haploid genotype (haplotype) networks for 12,235 protein coding genes. The structure of these networks varies widely among genes, indicating different patterns of variation despite a shared evolutionary history. We focus on those genes whose genotype networks show many cycles, which can indicate homoplasy, i.e., parallel or convergent evolution, on the sequence level.
Conclusion: For 42 genes, the observed number of cycles is so large that it cannot be explained by either chance homoplasy or recombination. When analyzing possible explanations, we discovered evidence for positive selection in 21 of these genes and, in addition, a potential role for constrained variation and purifying selection. Balancing selection plays at most a small role. The 42 genes with excess cycles are enriched in functions related to immunity and response to pathogens. Genotype networks are representations of genetic variation data that can help understand unusual patterns of genomic variation.},

	abstract = {Background: Bread wheat is an allopolyploid species with a large, highly repetitive genome. To investigate the impact of selection on variants distributed among homoeologous wheat genomes and to build a foundation for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships, we performed population-scale re-sequencing of a diverse panel of wheat lines.
Results: A sample of 62 diverse lines was re-sequenced using the whole exome capture and genotyping-by-sequencing approaches. We describe the allele frequency, functional significance, and chromosomal distribution of 1.57 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 161,719 small indels. Our results suggest that duplicated homoeologous genes are under purifying selection. We find contrasting patterns of variation and inter-variant associations among wheat genomes; this, in addition to demographic factors, could be explained by differences in the effect of directional selection on duplicated homoeologs. Only a small fraction of the homoeologous regions harboring selected variants overlapped among the wheat genomes in any given wheat line. These selected regions are enriched for loci associated with agronomic traits detected in genome-wide association studies.
Conclusions: Evidence suggests that directional selection in allopolyploids rarely acted on multiple parallel advantageous mutations across homoeologous regions, likely indicating that a fitness benefit could be obtained by a mutation at any one of the homoeologs. Additional advantageous variants in other homoelogs probably either contributed little benefit, or were unavailable in populations subjected to directional selection. We hypothesize that allopolyploidy may have increased the likelihood of beneficial allele recovery by broadening the set of possible selection targets.},

            The Genetic Society of America’s Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal is awarded to an individual GSA member for lifetime achievement in the field of genetics. For over 40 years, 2015 recipient Brian Charlesworth has been a leader in both theoretical and empirical evolutionary genetics, making substantial contributions to our understanding of how evolution acts on genetic variation. Some of the areas in which Charlesworth’s research has been most influential are the evolution of sex chromosomes, transposable elements, deleterious mutations, sexual reproduction, and life history. He also developed the influential theory of background selection, whereby the recurrent elimination of deleterious mutations reduces variation at linked sites, providing a general explanation for the correlation between recombination rate and genetic variation.},

	abstract = {Background: Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that can bind to DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. Many TFs are master regulators in cells that contribute to tissue-specific and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in eukaryotes. Maize has been a model organism for over one hundred years, but little is known about its tissue-specific gene regulation through TFs. In this study, we used a network approach to elucidate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in four tissues (leaf, root, SAM and seed) in maize. We utilized GENIE3, a machine-learning algorithm combined with large quantity of RNA-Seq expression data to construct four tissue-specific GRNs. Unlike some other techniques, this approach is not limited by high-quality Position Weighed Matrix (PWM), and can therefore predict GRNs for over 2000 TFs in maize.
Results: Although many TFs were expressed across multiple tissues, a multi-tiered analysis predicted tissue-specific regulatory functions for many transcription factors. Some well-studied TFs emerged within the four tissue-specific GRNs, and the GRN predictions matched expectations based upon published results for many of these examples. Our GRNs were also validated by ChIP-Seq datasets (KN1, FEA4 and O2). Key TFs were identified for each tissue and matched expectations for key regulators in each tissue, including GO enrichment and identity with known regulatory factors for that tissue. We also found functional modules in each network by clustering analysis with the MCL algorithm.
Conclusions: By combining publicly available genome-wide expression data and network analysis, we can uncover GRNs at tissue-level resolution in maize. Since ChIP-Seq and PWMs are still limited in several model organisms, our study provides a uniform platform that can be adapted to any species with genome-wide expression data to construct GRNs. We also present a publicly available database, maize tissue-specific GRN (mGRN, https://www.bio.fsu.edu/mcginnislab/ mgrn/), for easy querying. All source code and data are available at Github (https://github.com/timedreamer/maize\_ tissue-specific\_GRN).},

              In the approaching decades, food security will likely be more of an issue as there will be an increased demand for grain which will need to be met in an environmentally sustainable manner. To date, commercial transgenic maize has primarily targeted resistance to insects and herbicides. Here we describe a transgenic approach to improve the yield and yield stability of maize. We have demonstrated that increasing and extending the expression of a maize gene,
              zmm28
              , alters vegetative and reproductive growth parameters and significantly enhances yield in large-scale field trials conducted over multiple years. We conclude that alteration in expression of a native maize gene in maize can create a substantially positive change in a complex trait like grain yield.
            
          , 
            
              Increasing maize grain yield has been a major focus of both plant breeding and genetic engineering to meet the global demand for food, feed, and industrial uses. We report that increasing and extending expression of a maize MADS-box transcription factor gene,
              zmm28
              , under the control of a moderate-constitutive maize promoter, results in maize plants with increased plant growth, photosynthesis capacity, and nitrogen utilization. Molecular and biochemical characterization of
              zmm28
              transgenic plants demonstrated that their enhanced agronomic traits are associated with elevated plant carbon assimilation, nitrogen utilization, and plant growth. Overall, these positive attributes are associated with a significant increase in grain yield relative to wild-type controls that is consistent across years, environments, and elite germplasm backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Background: Studies of gene regulation often utilize genome-wide predictions of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Most existing prediction methods are based on sequence information alone, ignoring biological contexts such as developmental stages and tissue types. Experimental methods to study in vivo binding, including ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq, can only study one transcription factor in a single cell type and under a specific condition in each experiment, and therefore cannot scale to determine the full set of regulatory interactions in mammalian transcriptional regulatory networks.
Results: We developed a new computational approach, PIPES, for predicting tissue-specific TF binding. PIPES integrates in vitro protein binding microarrays (PBMs), sequence conservation and tissue-specific epigenetic (DNase I hypersensitivity) information. We demonstrate that PIPES improves over existing methods on distinguishing between in vivo bound and unbound sequences using ChIP-seq data for 11 mouse TFs. In addition, our predictions are in good agreement with current knowledge of tissue-specific TF regulation.
Conclusions: We provide a systematic map of computationally predicted tissue-specific binding targets for 284 mouse TFs across 55 tissue/cell types. Such comprehensive resource is useful for researchers studying gene regulation.},

            PathBank (www.pathbank.org) is a new, comprehensive, visually rich pathway database containing more than 110 000 machine-readable pathways found in 10 model organisms (Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). PathBank aims to provide a pathway for every protein and a map for every metabolite. This resource is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and systems biology. It provides detailed, fully searchable, hyperlinked diagrams of metabolic, metabolite signaling, protein signaling, disease, drug and physiological pathways. All PathBank pathways include information on the relevant organs, organelles, subcellular compartments, cofactors, molecular locations, chemical structures and protein quaternary structures. Each small molecule is hyperlinked to the rich data contained in public chemical databases such as HMDB or DrugBank and each protein or enzyme complex is hyperlinked to UniProt. All PathBank pathways are accompanied with references and detailed descriptions which provide an overview of the pathway, condition or processes depicted in each diagram. Every PathBank pathway is downloadable in several machine-readable and image formats including BioPAX, SBML, PWML, SBGN, RXN, PNG and SVG. PathBank also supports community annotations and submissions through the web-based PathWhiz pathway illustrator. The vast majority of PathBank's pathways (\&gt;95\%) are not found in any other public pathway database.},

              The mutualistic association between leguminous plants and endosymbiotic rhizobial bacteria is a paradigmatic example of a symbiosis driven by metabolic exchanges. Here, we report the reconstruction and modelling of a genome-scale metabolic network of
              Medicago truncatula
              (plant) nodulated by
              Sinorhizobium meliloti
              (bacterium). The reconstructed nodule tissue contains five spatially distinct developmental zones and encompasses the metabolism of both the plant and the bacterium. Flux balance analysis (FBA) suggests that the metabolic costs associated with symbiotic nitrogen fixation are primarily related to supporting nitrogenase activity, and increasing N

              2
              fixation depends on proton transfer from the plant cytoplasm to the bacteria through acidification of the peribacteroid space. We expect that our model, called ‘Virtual Nodule Environment’ (ViNE), will contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of legume nodules, and may guide experimental studies and engineering of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.},

	abstract = {Background: The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to the emergence of many methods for removing systematic technical noises, including imputation methods, which aim to address the increased sparsity observed in single-cell data. Although many imputation methods have been developed, there is no consensus on how methods compare to each other.
Results: Here, we perform a systematic evaluation of 18 scRNA-seq imputation methods to assess their accuracy and usability. We benchmark these methods in terms of the similarity between imputed cell profiles and bulk samples and whether these methods recover relevant biological signals or introduce spurious noise in downstream differential expression, unsupervised clustering, and pseudotemporal trajectory analyses, as well as their computational run time, memory usage, and scalability. Methods are evaluated using data from both cell lines and tissues and from both plateand droplet-based single-cell platforms.
Conclusions: We found that the majority of scRNA-seq imputation methods outperformed no imputation in recovering gene expression observed in bulk RNA-seq. However, the majority of the methods did not improve performance in downstream analyses compared to no imputation, in particular for clustering and trajectory analysis, and thus should be used with caution. In addition, we found substantial variability in the performance of the methods within each evaluation aspect. Overall, MAGIC, kNN-smoothing, and SAVER were found to outperform the other methods most consistently.},

              Understanding global communications among cells requires accurate representation of cell-cell signaling links and effective systems-level analyses of those links. We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (
              http://www.cellchat.org/
              ) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues.},

            Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides details for individual cells; however, crucial spatial information is often lost. We present SpaOTsc, a method relying on structured optimal transport to recover spatial properties of scRNA-seq data by utilizing spatial measurements of a relatively small number of genes. A spatial metric for individual cells in scRNA-seq data is first established based on a map connecting it with the spatial measurements. The cell–cell communications are then obtained by “optimally transporting” signal senders to target signal receivers in space. Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene–gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells. Four datasets are employed for cross-validation of spatial gene expression prediction and comparison to known cell–cell communications. SpaOTsc has broader applications, both in integrating non-spatial single-cell measurements with spatial data, and directly in spatial single-cell transcriptomics data to reconstruct spatial cellular dynamics in tissues.},

            Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is being used widely to resolve cellular heterogeneity. With the rapid accumulation of public scRNA-seq data, an effective and efficient cell-querying method is critical for the utilization of the existing annotations to curate newly sequenced cells. Such a querying method should be based on an accurate cell-to-cell similarity measure, and capable of handling batch effects properly. Herein, we present Cell BLAST, an accurate and robust cell-querying method built on a neural network-based generative model and a customized cell-to-cell similarity metric. Through extensive benchmarks and case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Cell BLAST in annotating discrete cell types and continuous cell differentiation potential, as well as identifying novel cell types. Powered by a well-curated reference database and a user-friendly Web server, Cell BLAST provides the one-stop solution for real-world scRNA-seq cell querying and annotation.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the unbiased, high-throughput quantification of gene expression specific to cell types and states. With the cost of scRNA-seq decreasing and techniques for sample multiplexing improving, population-scale scRNA-seq, and thus single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) mapping, is increasingly feasible. Mapping of sc-eQTL provides additional resolution to study the regulatory role of common genetic variants on gene expression across a plethora of cell types and states and promises to improve our understanding of genetic regulation across tissues in both health and disease.
Results: While previously established methods for bulk eQTL mapping can, in principle, be applied to sc-eQTL mapping, there are a number of open questions about how best to process scRNA-seq data and adapt bulk methods to optimize sceQTL mapping. Here, we evaluate the role of different normalization and aggregation strategies, covariate adjustment techniques, and multiple testing correction methods to establish best practice guidelines. We use both real and simulated datasets across single-cell technologies to systematically assess the impact of these different statistical approaches.
Conclusion: We provide recommendations for future single-cell eQTL studies that can yield up to twice as many eQTL discoveries as default approaches ported from bulk studies.},

              The genetic landscape of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been elusive. By analyzing mtDNA using the whole genome sequence (WGS) of Japanese individuals (
              n
               = 1928), we identified 2023 mtDNA variants and high-resolution haplogroups. Frequency spectra of the haplogroups were population-specific and were heterogeneous among geographic regions within Japan. Application of machine learning methods could finely classify the subjects corresponding to the high-digit mtDNA sub-haplogroups. mtDNA had distinct genetic structures from that of nuclear DNA (nDNA), characterized by no distance-dependent linkage disequilibrium decay, sparse tagging of common variants, and the existence of common haplotypes spanning the entire mtDNA. We did not detect any evidence of mtDNA–nDNA (or mtDNA copy number–nDNA) genotype associations. Together with WGS-based mtDNA variant imputation, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of 147,437 Japanese individuals with 99 clinical phenotypes. We observed pleiotropy of mtDNA genetic risk on the five late-onset human complex traits including creatine kinase (

              Motivation
              The overall association evidence of a genetic variant with multiple traits can be evaluated by cross-phenotype association analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Further dissecting the association pathways from a variant to multiple traits is important to understand the biological causal relationships among complex traits.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we introduce a flexible and computationally efficient Iterative Mendelian Randomization and Pleiotropy (IMRP) approach to simultaneously search for horizontal pleiotropic variants and estimate causal effect. Extensive simulations and real data applications suggest that IMRP has similar or better performance than existing Mendelian Randomization methods for both causal effect estimation and pleiotropic variant detection. The developed pleiotropy test is further extended to detect colocalization for multiple variants at a locus.

	abstract = {Synopsis
            The concept of trade-offs permeates our thinking about adaptive evolution because they are exhibited at every level of biological organization, from molecular and cellular processes to organismal and ecological functions. Trade-offs inevitably arise because different traits do not occur in isolation, but instead are imbedded within complex, integrated systems that make up whole organisms. The genetic and mechanistic underpinning of trade-offs can be found in the pleiotropic nodes that occur in the biological pathways shared between traits. Yet, often trade-offs are only understood as statistical correlations, limiting the ability to evaluate the interplay between how selection and constraint interact during adaptive evolution. Here, we first review the classic paradigms in which physiologists and evolutionary biologists have studied trade-offs and highlight the ways in which network and molecular pathway approaches unify these paradigms. We discuss how these approaches allow researchers to evaluate why trade-offs arise and how selection can act to overcome trait correlations and evolutionary constraints. We argue that understanding how the conserved molecular pathways are shared between different traits and functions provides a conceptual framework for evolutionary biologists, physiologists, and molecular biologists to meaningfully work together toward the goal of understanding why correlations and trade-offs occur between traits. We briefly highlight the melanocortin system and the hormonal control of osmoregulation as two case studies where an understanding of shared molecular pathways reveals why trade-offs occur between seemingly unrelated traits. While we recognize that applying such approaches poses challenges and limitations particularly in the context of natural populations, we advocate for the view that focusing on the biological pathways responsible for trade-offs provides a unified conceptual context accessible to a broad range of integrative biologists.},

            The proliferation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has prompted the use of two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) for drawing reliable causal relationships between health risk factors and disease outcomes. However, the unique features of GWAS demand that MR methods account for both linkage disequilibrium (LD) and ubiquitously existing horizontal pleiotropy among complex traits, which is the phenomenon wherein a variant affects the outcome through mechanisms other than exclusively through the exposure. Therefore, statistical methods that fail to consider LD and horizontal pleiotropy can lead to biased estimates and false-positive causal relationships. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a probabilistic model for MR analysis in identifying the causal effects between risk factors and disease outcomes using GWAS summary statistics in the presence of LD and to properly account for horizontal pleiotropy among genetic variants (MR-LDP) and develop a computationally efficient algorithm to make the causal inference. We then conducted comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the advantages of MR-LDP over the existing methods. Moreover, we used two real exposure–outcome pairs to validate the results from MR-LDP compared with alternative methods, showing that our method is more efficient in using all-instrumental variants in LD. By further applying MR-LDP to lipid traits and body mass index (BMI) as risk factors for complex diseases, we identified multiple pairs of significant causal relationships, including a protective effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on peripheral vascular disease and a positive causal effect of BMI on hemorrhoids.},

            Mendelian randomization (MR) is an epidemiological technique that uses genetic variants to distinguish correlation from causation in observational data. The reliability of a MR investigation depends on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs). We develop the contamination mixture method, a method for MR with two modalities. First, it identifies groups of genetic variants with similar causal estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Second, it performs MR robustly and efficiently in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, it has the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method identifies 11 variants associated with increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased coronary heart disease risk that have the same directions of associations with various blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and coronary heart disease risk mediated via platelet aggregation.},

              , identifying hundreds of nucleotide variants associated with morphological and life history traits. Alleles that delayed flowering also increased size at reproduction, which suggests pervasive antagonistic pleiotropy in this annual plant. The “large and slow” alleles, which were less common in small, rapidly flowering populations, became more abundant in populations with greater plant size. Furthermore, natural selection within the field population favored alternative alleles from year to year. Our results suggest that environmental fluctuations and selective trade-offs maintain polygenic trait variation within populations and also contribute to the geographic divergence in this wildflower species.},

              To dissect the genotype-phenotype landscape of a cell, it is necessary to understand interactions between genes. Building on the digenic protein-protein interaction network, Kuzmin
              et al.
              created a trigenic landscape of yeast by using a synthetic genetic array (see the Perspective by Walhout). Triple-mutant analyses indicated that the majority of genes with trigenic associations functioned within the same biological processes. These converged on networks identified in the digenic interaction landscape. Although the overall effects were weaker for trigenic than for digenic interactions, trigenic interactions were more likely to bridge biological processes in the cell.

              INTRODUCTION
              Genetic interactions occur when mutations in different genes combine to result in a phenotype that is different from expectation based on those of the individual mutations. Negative genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations leads to a fitness defect that is more exacerbated than expected. For example, synthetic lethality occurs when two mutations, neither of which is lethal on its own, generate an inviable double mutant. Alternatively, positive genetic interactions occur when genetic perturbations combine to generate a double mutant with a greater fitness than expected. Global digenic interaction studies have been useful for understanding the functional wiring diagram of the cell and may also provide insight into the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, which is important for tracking the missing heritability of human health and disease. Here we describe a network of higher-order trigenic interactions and explore its implications.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Variation in phenotypic outcomes in different individuals is caused by genetic determinants that act as modifiers. Modifier loci are prevalent in human populations, but knowledge regarding how variants interact to modulate phenotype in different individuals is lacking. Similarly, in yeast, traits including conditional essentiality—in which certain genes are essential in one genetic background but nonessential in another—often result from an interplay of multiple modifier loci. Because complex modifiers may underlie the genetic basis of physiological states found in natural populations, it is critical to understand the landscape of higher-order genetic interactions.
            
            
              RESULTS
              To survey trigenic interactions, we designed query strains that sampled key features of the global digenic interaction network: (i) digenic interaction strength, (ii) average number of digenic interactions, and (iii) digenic interaction profile similarity. In total, we tested {\textasciitilde}400,000 double and {\textasciitilde}200,000 triple mutants for fitness defects and identified {\textasciitilde}9500 digenic and {\textasciitilde}3200 trigenic negative interactions. Although trigenic interactions tend to be weaker than digenic interactions, they were both enriched for functional relationships. About one-third of trigenic interactions identified “novel” connections that were not observed in our digenic control network, whereas the remaining approximately two-thirds of trigenic interactions “modified” a digenic interaction, suggesting that the global digenic interaction network is important for understanding the trigenic interaction network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions also bridged distant bioprocesses. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is {\textasciitilde}100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The extensive network of trigenic interactions and their ability to generate functionally diverse phenotypes suggest that higher-order genetic interactions may play a key role in the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, genome size, and speciation.
              
                
                  Systematic analysis of trigenic interactions.
                  
                    We surveyed
                    
                    for trigenic interactions and found that they are {\textasciitilde}100 times as prevalent as digenic interactions, often modify a digenic interaction, and connect functionally related genes as well as genes in more diverse bioprocesses (multicolored nodes).

          , 
            To systematically explore complex genetic interactions, we constructed {\textasciitilde}200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction network and tested for a genetic interaction with a third mutation. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is {\textasciitilde}100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic interactions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.},

              The analyses of multi-omics data have revealed candidate genes for objective traits. However, they are integrated poorly, especially in non-model organisms, and they pose a great challenge for prioritizing candidate genes for follow-up experimental verification. Here, we present a general convolutional neural network model that integrates multi-omics information to prioritize the candidate genes of objective traits. By applying this model to
              Sus scrofa
              , which is a non-model organism, but one of the most important livestock animals, the model precision was 72.9\%, recall 73.5\%, and F1-Measure 73.4\%, demonstrating a good prediction performance compared with previous studies in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              and
              Oryza sativa
              . Additionally, to facilitate the use of the model, we present ISwine (
              http://iswine.iomics.pro/
              ), which is an online comprehensive knowledgebase in which we incorporated almost all the published swine multi-omics data. Overall, the results suggest that the deep learning strategy will greatly facilitate analyses of multi-omics integration in the future.},

            Integration analysis of multi-omics data provides a comprehensive landscape for understanding biological systems and mechanisms. The abundance of high-quality multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics and phenomics) for the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana enables scientists to study the genetic mechanism of many biological processes. However, no resource is available to provide comprehensive and systematic multi-omics associations for Arabidopsis. Here, we developed an Arabidopsis thaliana Multi-omics Association Database (AtMAD, http://www.megabionet.org/atmad), a public repository for large-scale measurements of associations between genome, transcriptome, methylome, pathway and phenotype in Arabidopsis, designed for facilitating identification of eQTL, emQTL, Pathway-mQTL, Phenotype-pathway, GWAS, TWAS and EWAS. Candidate variants/methylations/genes were identified in AtMAD for specific phenotypes or biological processes, many of them are supported by experimental evidence. Based on the multi-omics association strategy, we have identified 11 796 cis-eQTLs and 10 119 trans-eQTLs. Among them, 68 837 environment-eQTL associations and 149 622 GWAS-eQTL associations were identified and stored in AtMAD. For expression–methylation quantitative trait loci (emQTL), we identified 265 776 emQTLs and 122 344 pathway-mQTLs. For TWAS and EWAS, we obtained 62 754 significant phenotype-gene associations and 3 993 379 significant phenotype-methylation associations, respectively. Overall, the multi-omics associated network in AtMAD will provide new insights into exploring biological mechanisms of plants at multi-omics levels.},

              Overtreatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a major issue in the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), and currently none of the reported biomarkers for predicting response have been implemented in the clinic. Here we perform a comprehensive multi-omics analysis (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics) of 300 MIBC patients treated with chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or first-line) to identify molecular changes associated with treatment response. DNA-based associations with response converge on genomic instability driven by a high number of chromosomal alterations, indels, signature 5 mutations and/or
              BRCA2
              mutations. Expression data identifies the basal/squamous gene expression subtype to be associated with poor response. Immune cell infiltration and high PD-1 protein expression are associated with treatment response. Through integration of genomic and transcriptomic data, we demonstrate patient stratification to groups of low and high likelihood of cisplatin-based response. This could pave the way for future patient selection following validation in prospective clinical trials.},

            Structural variants (SVs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) comprise a broad group of diverse DNA variants which vastly differ in their sizes and distributions across the genome. Here, we identify genomic features of SV classes and STRs that are associated with gene expression and complex traits, including their locations relative to eGenes, likelihood of being associated with multiple eGenes, associated eGene types (e.g., coding, noncoding, level of evolutionary constraint), effect sizes, linkage disequilibrium with tagging single nucleotide variants used in GWAS, and likelihood of being associated with GWAS traits. We identify a set of high-impact SVs/STRs associated with the expression of three or more eGenes via chromatin loops and show that they are highly enriched for being associated with GWAS traits.

              Current machine learning classifiers have successfully been applied to whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but they lack causal interpretation. Here we present a metabolic model-based machine learning classifier, named Metabolic Allele Classifier (MAC), that uses flux balance analysis to estimate the biochemical effects of alleles. We apply the MAC to a dataset of 1595 drug-tested
              Mycobacterium tuberculosis
              strains and show that MACs predict AMR phenotypes with accuracy on par with mechanism-agnostic machine learning models (isoniazid AUC = 0.93) while enabling a biochemical interpretation of the genotype-phenotype map. Interpretation of MACs for three antibiotics (pyrazinamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid) recapitulates known AMR mechanisms and suggest a biochemical basis for how the identified alleles cause AMR. Extending flux balance analysis to identify accurate sequence classifiers thus contributes mechanistic insights to GWAS, a field thus far dominated by mechanism-agnostic results.},

            Interferon-α (IFNα), a type I interferon, is expressed in the islets of type 1 diabetic individuals, and its expression and signaling are regulated by T1D genetic risk variants and viral infections associated with T1D. We presently characterize human beta cell responses to IFNα by combining ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and proteomics assays. The initial response to IFNα is characterized by chromatin remodeling, followed by changes in transcriptional and translational regulation. IFNα induces changes in alternative splicing (AS) and first exon usage, increasing the diversity of transcripts expressed by the beta cells. This, combined with changes observed on protein modification/degradation, ER stress and MHC class I, may expand antigens presented by beta cells to the immune system. Beta cells also up-regulate the checkpoint proteins PDL1 and HLA-E that may exert a protective role against the autoimmune assault. Data mining of the present multi-omics analysis identifies two compound classes that antagonize IFNα effects on human beta cells.},

            High-throughput techniques have generated abundant genetic and transcriptomic data of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients but data analysis approaches such as traditional statistical methods have not provided much in the way of insightful integrated analysis or interpretation of the data. As an advanced computational approach, machine learning, which enables people to identify complex patterns and insight from data, has consequently been harnessed to analyze and interpret large, highly complex genetic and transcriptomic data toward a better understanding of PD. In particular, machine learning models have been developed to integrate patient genotype data alone or combined with demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and other information, for PD outcome study. They have also been used to identify biomarkers of PD based on transcriptomic data, e.g., gene expression profiles from microarrays. This study overviews the relevant literature on using machine learning models for genetic and transcriptomic data analysis in PD, points out remaining challenges, and suggests future directions accordingly. Undoubtedly, the use of machine learning is amplifying PD genetic and transcriptomic achievements for accelerating the study of PD. Existing studies have demonstrated the great potential of machine learning in discovering hidden patterns within genetic or transcriptomic information and thus revealing clues underpinning pathology and pathogenesis. Moving forward, by addressing the remaining challenges, machine learning may advance our ability to precisely diagnose, prognose, and treat PD.},

              Motivation
              Biological systems function through dynamic interactions among genes and their products, regulatory circuits and metabolic networks. Our development of the Pathway Tools software was motivated by the need to construct biological knowledge resources that combine these many types of data, and that enable users to find and comprehend data of interest as quickly as possible through query and visualization tools. Further, we sought to support the development of metabolic flux models from pathway databases, and to use pathway information to leverage the interpretation of high-throughput data sets.
            
            
              Results
              In the past 4 years we have enhanced the already extensive Pathway Tools software in several respects. It can now support metabolic-model execution through the Web, it provides a more accurate gap filler for metabolic models; it supports development of models for organism communities distributed across a spatial grid; and model results may be visualized graphically. Pathway Tools supports several new omics-data analysis tools including the Omics Dashboard, multi-pathway diagrams called pathway collages, a pathway-covering algorithm for metabolomics data analysis and an algorithm for generating mechanistic explanations of multi-omics data. We have also improved the core pathway/genome databases management capabilities of the software, providing new multi-organism search tools for organism communities, improved graphics rendering, faster performance and re-designed gene and metabolite pages.
            
            
              Availability
              The software is free for academic use; a fee is required for commercial use. See http://pathwaytools.com.

            Genetic correlation is the correlation of phenotypic effects by genetic variants across the genome on two phenotypes. It is an informative metric to quantify the overall genetic similarity between complex traits, which provides insights into their polygenic genetic architecture. Several methods have been proposed to estimate genetic correlation based on data collected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Due to the easy access of GWAS summary statistics and computational efficiency, methods only requiring GWAS summary statistics as input have become more popular than methods utilizing individual-level genotype data. Here, we present a benchmark study for different summary-statistics-based genetic correlation estimation methods through simulation and real data applications. We focus on two major technical challenges in estimating genetic correlation: marker dependency caused by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sample overlap between different studies. To assess the performance of different methods in the presence of these two challenges, we first conducted comprehensive simulations with diverse LD patterns and sample overlaps. Then we applied these methods to real GWAS summary statistics for a wide spectrum of complex traits. Based on these experiments, we conclude that methods relying on accurate LD estimation are less robust in real data applications due to the imprecision of LD obtained from reference panels. Our findings offer guidance on how to choose appropriate methods for genetic correlation estimation in post-GWAS analysis.},

            High-dimensional multi-omics data are now standard in biology. They can greatly enhance our understanding of biological systems when effectively integrated. To achieve proper integration, joint Dimensionality Reduction (jDR) methods are among the most efficient approaches. However, several jDR methods are available, urging the need for a comprehensive benchmark with practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of nine representative jDR methods using three complementary benchmarks. First, we evaluate their performances in retrieving ground-truth sample clustering from simulated multi-omics datasets. Second, we use TCGA cancer data to assess their strengths in predicting survival, clinical annotations and known pathways/biological processes. Finally, we assess their classification of multi-omics single-cell data. From these in-depth comparisons, we observe that intNMF performs best in clustering, while MCIA offers an effective behavior across many contexts. The code developed for this benchmark study is implemented in a Jupyter notebook—multi-omics mix (momix)—to foster reproducibility, and support users and future developers.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            To fully utilize the advances in omics technologies and achieve a more comprehensive understanding of human diseases, novel computational methods are required for integrative analysis of multiple types of omics data. Here, we present a novel multi-omics integrative method named Multi-Omics Graph cOnvolutional NETworks (MOGONET) for biomedical classification. MOGONET jointly explores omics-specific learning and cross-omics correlation learning for effective multi-omics data classification. We demonstrate that MOGONET outperforms other state-of-the-art supervised multi-omics integrative analysis approaches from different biomedical classification applications using mRNA expression data, DNA methylation data, and microRNA expression data. Furthermore, MOGONET can identify important biomarkers from different omics data types related to the investigated biomedical problems.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent advances in genomics have greatly increased research opportunities for non-model species. For wildlife, a growing availability of reference genomes means that population genetics is no longer restricted to a small set of anonymous loci. When used in conjunction with a reference genome, reduced-representation sequencing (RRS) provides a cost-effective method for obtaining reliable diversity information for population genetics. Many software tools have been developed to process RRS data, though few studies of non-model species incorporate genome alignment in calling loci. A commonly-used RRS analysis pipeline, Stacks, has this capacity and so it is timely to compare its utility with existing software originally designed for alignment and analysis of whole genome sequencing data. Here we examine population genetic inferences from two species for which reference-aligned reduced-representation data have been collected. Our two study species are a threatened Australian marsupial (Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii; declining population) and an Arctic-circle migrant bird (pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus; expanding population). Analyses of these data are compared using Stacks versus two widely-used genomics packages, SAMtools and GATK. We also introduce a custom R script to improve the reliability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls in all pipelines and conduct population genetic inferences for non-model species with reference genomes.
Results: Although we identified orders of magnitude fewer SNPs in our devil dataset than for goose, we found remarkable symmetry between the two species in our assessment of software performance. For both datasets, all three methods were able to delineate population structure, even with varying numbers of loci. For both species, population structure inferences were influenced by the percent of missing data.
Conclusions: For studies of non-model species with a reference genome, we recommend combining Stacks output with further filtering (as included in our R pipeline) for population genetic studies, paying particular attention to potential impact of missing data thresholds. We recognise SAMtools as a viable alternative for researchers more familiar with this software. We caution against the use of GATK in studies with limited computational resources or time.},

	abstract = {Background:  Genotyping of sequence variants typically involves, as a first step, the alignment of sequencing reads to a linear reference genome. Because a linear reference genome represents only a small fraction of all the DNA sequence variation within a species, reference allele bias may occur at highly polymorphic or divergent regions of the genome. Graph-based methods facilitate the comparison of sequencing reads to a variation-aware genome graph, which incorporates a collection of non-redundant DNA sequences that segregate within a species. We compared the accuracy and sensitivity of graph-based sequence variant genotyping using the Graphtyper software to two widelyused methods, i.e., GATK and SAMtools, which rely on linear reference genomes using whole-genome sequencing data from 49 Original Braunvieh cattle.
Results:  We discovered 21,140,196, 20,262,913, and 20,668,459 polymorphic sites using GATK, Graphtyper, and SAMtools, respectively. Comparisons between sequence variant genotypes and microarray-derived genotypes showed that Graphtyper outperformed both GATK and SAMtools in terms of genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity, and non-reference discrepancy. The sequence variant genotypes that were obtained using Graphtyper had the smallest number of Mendelian inconsistencies between sequence-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in nine sire-son pairs. Genotype phasing and imputation using the Beagle software improved the quality of the sequence variant genotypes for all the tools evaluated, particularly for animals that were sequenced at low coverage. Following imputation, the concordance between sequence- and microarray-derived genotypes was almost identical for the three methods evaluated, i.e., 99.32, 99.46, and 99.24\% for GATK, Graphtyper, and SAMtools, respectively. Variant filtration based on commonly used criteria improved genotype concordance slightly but it also decreased sensitivity. Graphtyper required considerably more computing resources than SAMtools but less than GATK.
Conclusions:  Sequence variant genotyping using Graphtyper is accurate, sensitive and computationally feasible in cattle. Graph-based methods enable sequence variant genotyping from variation-aware reference genomes that may incorporate cohort-specific sequence variants, which is not possible with the current implementation of state-of-theart methods that rely on linear reference genomes.},

              INTRODUCTION
              Characterizing genetic variants underlying local adaptations in human populations is one of the central goals of evolutionary research. Most studies have focused on adaptive single-nucleotide variants that either arose as new beneficial mutations or were introduced after interbreeding with our now-extinct relatives, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. The adaptive role of copy number variants (CNVs), another well-known form of genomic variation generated through deletions or duplications that affect more base pairs in the genome, is less well understood, despite evidence that such mutations are subject to stronger selective pressures.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              This study focuses on the discovery of introgressed and adaptive CNVs that have become enriched in specific human populations. We combine whole-genome CNV calling and population genetic inference methods to discover CNVs and then assess signals of selection after controlling for demographic history. We examine 266 publicly available modern human genomes from the Simons Genome Diversity Project and genomes of three ancient hominins—a Denisovan, a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains in Siberia, and a Neanderthal from Croatia. We apply long-read sequencing methods to sequence-resolve complex CNVs of interest specifically in the Melanesians—an Oceanian population distributed from Papua New Guinea to as far east as the islands of Fiji and known to harbor some of the greatest amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestry.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                Consistent with the hypothesis of archaic introgression outside Africa, we find a significant excess of CNV sharing between modern non-African populations and archaic hominins (
                P
                = 0.039). Among Melanesians, we observe an enrichment of CNVs with potential signals of positive selection (
                n
                = 37 CNVs), of which 19 CNVs likely introgressed from archaic hominins. We show that Melanesian-stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signals of positive selection (
                P
                = 0.0323). Many map near or within genes associated with metabolism (e.g.,
                ACOT1
                and
                ACOT2
                ), development and cell cycle or signaling (e.g.,
                TNFRSF10D
                and
                CDK11A
                and
                CDK11B
                ), or immune response (e.g.,
                IFNLR1
                ). We characterize two of the largest and most complex CNVs on chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 that introgressed from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively, and are absent from most other human populations. At chromosome 16p11.2, we sequence-resolve a large duplication of {\textgreater}383 thousand base pairs (kbp) that originated from Denisovans and introgressed into the ancestral Melanesian population 60,000 to 170,000 years ago. This large duplication occurs at high frequency ({\textgreater}79\%) in diverse Melanesian groups, shows signatures of positive selection, and maps adjacent to
                Homo sapiens
                –specific duplications that predispose to rearrangements associated with autism. On chromosome 8p21.3, we identify a Melanesian haplotype that carries two CNVs, a {\textasciitilde}6-kbp deletion, and a {\textasciitilde}38-kbp duplication, with a Neanderthal origin and that introgressed into non-Africans 40,000 to 120,000 years ago. This CNV haplotype occurs at high frequency (44\%) and shows signals consistent with a partial selective sweep in Melanesians. Using long-read sequencing genomic and transcriptomic data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history for these two CNVs and discover previously undescribed duplicated genes (
                TNFRSF10D1
                ,
                TNFRSF10D2
                , and
                NPIPB16
                ) that show an excess of amino acid replacements consistent with the action of positive selection.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our results suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation that is absent from current reference genomes.

                    ,
                    TNFRSF10D2

                    NPIPB16
                    ) that are absent from the reference genome.
                  
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Copy number variants (CNVs) are subject to stronger selective pressure than single-nucleotide variants, but their roles in archaic introgression and adaptation have not been systematically investigated. We show that stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signatures of positive selection in Melanesians and provide evidence for adaptive introgression of large CNVs at chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively. Using long-read sequence data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history of these polymorphisms and show that both encode positively selected genes absent from most human populations. Our results collectively suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation.},

            The complete human genome sequence is used as a reference for next-generation sequencing analyses.

Here, we perform de novo assembly of three Japanese male genomes using {\textgreater} 100× Pacific Biosciences long reads and Bionano Genomics optical maps per sample. We integrate the genomes using the major allele for consensus and anchor the scaffolds using genetic and radiation hybrid maps to reconstruct each chromosome. The resulting genome sequence, JG1, is contiguous, accurate, and carries the Japanese major allele at most loci. We adopt JG1 as the reference for confirmatory exome re-analyses of seven rare-disease Japanese families and find that re-analysis using JG1 reduces total candidate variant calls versus GRCh37 while retaining disease-causing variants. These results suggest that integrating multiple genomes from a single population can aid genome analyses of that population.},

              Genetic diversity is key to crop improvement. Owing to pervasive genomic structural variation, a single reference genome assembly cannot capture the full complement of sequence diversity of a crop species (known as the ‘pan-genome’
              1
              ). Multiple high-quality sequence assemblies are an indispensable component of a pan-genome infrastructure. Barley (
              Hordeum vulgare
              L.) is an important cereal crop with a long history of cultivation that is adapted to a wide range of agro-climatic conditions
              2
              . Here we report the construction of chromosome-scale sequence assemblies for the genotypes of 20 varieties of barley—comprising landraces, cultivars and a wild barley—that were selected as representatives of global barley diversity. We catalogued genomic presence/absence variants and explored the use of structural variants for quantitative genetic analysis through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 300 gene bank accessions. We discovered abundant large inversion polymorphisms and analysed in detail two inversions that are frequently found in current elite barley germplasm; one is probably the product of mutation breeding and the other is tightly linked to a locus that is involved in the expansion of geographical range. This first-generation barley pan-genome makes previously hidden genetic variation accessible to genetic studies and breeding.},

	abstract = {Background: The dispensable genome of a species, consisting of the dispensable sequences present only in a subset of individuals, is believed to play important roles in phenotypic variation and genome evolution. However, construction of the dispensable genome is costly and labor-intensive at present, and so the influence of the dispensable genome in genetic and functional genomic studies has not been fully explored.
Results: We construct the dispensable genome of rice through a metagenome-like de novo assembly strategy based on low-coverage (1–3×) sequencing data of 1483 cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) accessions. Thousands of protein-coding genes are successfully assembled, including most of the known agronomically important genes absent from the Nipponbare rice reference genome. We develop an integration approach based on alignment and linkage disequilibrium, which is able to assign genomic positions relative to the reference genome for more than 78.2 \% of the dispensable sequences. We carry out association mapping studies for rice grain width and 840 metabolic traits using 0.46 million polymorphisms between the dispensable sequences of different rice accessions. About 23.5 \% of metabolic traits have more significant association signals with polymorphisms from dispensable sequences than with SNPs from the reference genome, and 41.6 \% of trait-associated SNPs have concordant genomic locations with associated dispensable sequences.
Conclusions: Our results suggest the feasibility of building a species’ dispensable genome using low-coverage population sequencing data. The constructed sequences will be helpful for understanding the rice dispensable genome and are complementary to the reference genome for identifying candidate genes associated with phenotypic variation.},

            The Hardness (Ha) locus controls grain hardness in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and its relatives (Triticum and Aegilops species) and represents a classical example of a trait whose variation arose from gene loss after polyploidization. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of the evolutionary events observed at this locus by comparing corresponding sequences of diploid, tertraploid, and hexaploid wheat species (Triticum and Aegilops). Genomic rearrangements, such as transposable element insertions, genomic deletions, duplications, and inversions, were shown to constitute the major differences when the same genomes (i.e., the A, B, or D genomes) were compared between species of different ploidy levels. The comparative analysis allowed us to determine the extent and sequences of the rearranged regions as well as rearrangement breakpoints and sequence motifs at their boundaries, which suggest rearrangement by illegitimate recombination. Among these genomic rearrangements, the previously reported Pina and Pinb genes loss from the Ha locus of polyploid wheat species was caused by a large genomic deletion that probably occurred independently in the A and B genomes. Moreover, the Ha locus in the D genome of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum) is 29 kb smaller than in the D genome of its diploid progenitor Ae. tauschii, principally because of transposable element insertions and two large deletions caused by illegitimate recombination. Our data suggest that illegitimate DNA recombination, leading to various genomic rearrangements, constitutes one of the major evolutionary mechanisms in wheat species.},

            Genome-wide structural and gene content variations are hypothesized to drive important phenotypic variation within a species. Structural and gene content variations were assessed among four soybean (Glycine max) genotypes using array hybridization and targeted resequencing. Many chromosomes exhibited relatively low rates of structural variation (SV) among genotypes. However, several regions exhibited both copy number and presence-absence variation, the most prominent found on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 16, and 18. Interestingly, the regions most enriched for SV were specifically localized to gene-rich regions that harbor clustered multigene families. The most abundant classes of gene families associated with these regions were the nucleotide-binding and receptor-like protein classes, both of which are important for plant biotic defense. The colocalization of SV with plant defense response signal transduction pathways provides insight into the mechanisms of soybean resistance gene evolution and may inform the development of new approaches to resistance gene cloning.},

              The
              rhg1-b
              allele of soybean is widely used for resistance against soybean cyst nematode (SCN), the most economically damaging pathogen of soybeans in the United States. Gene silencing showed that genes in a 31-kilobase segment at
              rhg1-b
              , encoding an amino acid transporter, an α-SNAP protein, and a WI12 (wound-inducible domain) protein, each contribute to resistance. There is one copy of the 31-kilobase segment per haploid genome in susceptible varieties, but 10 tandem copies are present in an
              rhg1-b
              haplotype. Overexpression of the individual genes in roots was ineffective, but overexpression of the genes together conferred enhanced SCN resistance. Hence, SCN resistance mediated by the soybean quantitative trait locus
              Rhg1
              is conferred by copy number variation that increases the expression of a set of dissimilar genes in a repeated multigene segment.

              Soybean crops, which supply valuable protein, oil, and renewable fuel, are under attack by a nematode for which there is no effective pesticide. Instead, agriculture relies on resistance derived from a genetic locus, which is now represented in most of the soybean crops cultivated in the United States.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Genomes at the species level are dynamic, with genes present in every individual (core) and genes in a subset of individuals (dispensable) that collectively constitute the pan-genome. Using transcriptome sequencing of seedling RNA from 503 maize (Zea mays) inbred lines to characterize the maize pan-genome, we identified 8681 representative transcript assemblies (RTAs) with 16.4\% expressed in all lines and 82.7\% expressed in subsets of the lines. Interestingly, with linkage disequilibrium mapping, 76.7\% of the RTAs with at least one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) could be mapped to a single genetic position, distributed primarily throughout the nonpericentromeric portion of the genome. Stepwise iterative clustering of RTAs suggests, within the context of the genotypes used in this study, that the maize genome is restricted and further sampling of seedling RNA within this germplasm base will result in minimal discovery. Genome-wide association studies based on SNPs and transcript abundance in the pan-genome revealed loci associated with the timing of the juvenile-to-adult vegetative and vegetative-to-reproductive developmental transitions, two traits important for fitness and adaptation. This study revealed the dynamic nature of the maize pan-genome and demonstrated that a substantial portion of variation may lie outside the single reference genome for a species.},

	abstract = {Background: Various methods are currently used to define species and are based on the phylogenetic marker 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence, DNA-DNA hybridization and DNA GC content. However, these are restricted genetic tools and showed significant limitations.
Results: In this work, we describe an alternative method to build taxonomy by analyzing the pan-genome composition of different species of the Klebsiella genus. Klebsiella species are Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the large Enterobacteriaceae family. Interestingly, when comparing the core/pan-genome ratio; we found a clear discontinuous variation that can define a new species.
Conclusions: Using this pan-genomic approach, we showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis are species of the Klebsiella genus, rather than subspecies of Klebsiella pneumoniae. This pan-genomic analysis, helped to develop a new tool for defining species introducing a quantic perspective for taxonomy. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by William Martin, Pierre Pontarotti and Pere Puigbo (nominated by Dr Yuri Wolf).},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies exploring sequence variation in the model legume, Medicago truncatula, relied on mapping short reads to a single reference. However, read-mapping approaches are inadequate to examine large, diverse gene families or to probe variation in repeat-rich or highly divergent genome regions. De novo sequencing and assembly of M. truncatula genomes enables near-comprehensive discovery of structural variants (SVs), analysis of rapidly evolving gene families, and ultimately, construction of a pan-genome.
Results: Genome-wide synteny based on 15 de novo M. truncatula assemblies effectively detected different types of SVs indicating that as much as 22\% of the genome is involved in large structural changes, altogether affecting 28\% of gene models. A total of 63 million base pairs (Mbp) of novel sequence was discovered, expanding the reference genome space for Medicago by 16\%. Pan-genome analysis revealed that 42\% (180 Mbp) of genomic sequences is missing in one or more accession, while examination of de novo annotated genes identified 67\% (50,700) of all ortholog groups as dispensable – estimates comparable to recent studies in rice, maize and soybean. Rapidly evolving gene families typically associated with biotic interactions and stress response were found to be enriched in the accession-specific gene pool. The nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family, in particular, harbors the highest level of nucleotide diversity, large effect single nucleotide change, protein diversity, and presence/ absence variation. However, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and heat shock gene families are disproportionately affected by large effect single nucleotide changes and even higher levels of copy number variation.
Conclusions: Analysis of multiple M. truncatula genomes illustrates the value of de novo assemblies to discover and describe structural variation, something that is often under-estimated when using read-mapping approaches. Comparisons among the de novo assemblies also indicate that different large gene families differ in the architecture of their structural variation.},

              Pan-cancer analyses that examine commonalities and differences among various cancer types have emerged as a powerful way to obtain novel insights into cancer biology. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in a pan-cancer cohort including 961 tumours from children, adolescents, and young adults, comprising 24 distinct molecular types of cancer. Using a standardized workflow, we identified marked differences in terms of mutation frequency and significantly mutated genes in comparison to previously analysed adult cancers. Genetic alterations in 149 putative cancer driver genes separate the tumours into two classes: small mutation and structural/copy-number variant (correlating with germline variants). Structural variants, hyperdiploidy, and chromothripsis are linked to
              TP53
              mutation status and mutational signatures. Our data suggest that 7–8\% of the children in this cohort carry an unambiguous predisposing germline variant and that nearly 50\% of paediatric neoplasms harbour a potentially druggable event, which is highly relevant for the design of future clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Background: Advances in medical technology have allowed for customized prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment regimens that utilize multiple heterogeneous data sources. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is well suited for the integration of multiple high throughput data sources. MKL remains to be under-utilized by genomic researchers partly due to the lack of unified guidelines for its use, and benchmark genomic datasets.
Results: We provide three implementations of MKL in R. These methods are applied to simulated data to illustrate that MKL can select appropriate models. We also apply MKL to combine clinical information with miRNA gene expression data of ovarian cancer study into a single analysis. Lastly, we show that MKL can identify gene sets that are known to play a role in the prognostic prediction of 15 cancer types using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as, identify new gene sets for the future research.
Conclusion: Multiple kernel learning coupled with modern optimization techniques provides a promising learning tool for building predictive models based on multi-source genomic data. MKL also provides an automated scheme for kernel prioritization and parameter tuning. The methods used in the paper are implemented as an R package called RMKL package, which is freely available for download through CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RMKL.},

            Machine learning methodologies can be applied readily to biological problems, but standard training and testing methods are not designed to control for evolutionary relatedness or other biological phenomena. In this article, we propose, implement, and test two methods to control for and utilize evolutionary relatedness within a predictive deep learning framework. The methods are tested and applied within the context of predicting mRNA expression levels from whole-genome DNA sequence data and are applicable across biological organisms. Potential use cases for the methods include plant and animal breeding, disease research, gene editing, and others.
          , 
            
              Deep learning methodologies have revolutionized prediction in many fields and show potential to do the same in molecular biology and genetics. However, applying these methods in their current forms ignores evolutionary dependencies within biological systems and can result in false positives and spurious conclusions. We developed two approaches that account for evolutionary relatedness in machine learning models: (
              i
              ) gene-family–guided splitting and (
              ii
              ) ortholog contrasts. The first approach accounts for evolution by constraining model training and testing sets to include different gene families. The second approach uses evolutionarily informed comparisons between orthologous genes to both control for and leverage evolutionary divergence during the training process. The two approaches were explored and validated within the context of mRNA expression level prediction and have the area under the ROC curve (auROC) values ranging from 0.75 to 0.94. Model weight inspections showed biologically interpretable patterns, resulting in the hypothesis that the 3′ UTR is more important for fine-tuning mRNA abundance levels while the 5′ UTR is more important for large-scale changes.},

            A machine learning approach exploiting the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations can extract detailed fluid flow information.
          , 
            For centuries, flow visualization has been the art of making fluid motion visible in physical and biological systems. Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.},

	abstract = {Background: The genetic bases of many complex phenotypes are still largely unknown, mostly due to the polygenic nature of the traits and the small effect of each associated mutation. An alternative approach to classic association studies to determining such genetic bases is an evolutionary framework. As sites targeted by natural selection are likely to harbor important functionalities for the carrier, the identification of selection signatures in the genome has the potential to unveil the genetic mechanisms underpinning human phenotypes. Popular methods of detecting such signals rely on compressing genomic information into summary statistics, resulting in the loss of information. Furthermore, few methods are able to quantify the strength of selection. Here we explored the use of deep learning in evolutionary biology and implemented a program, called ImaGene, to apply convolutional neural networks on population genomic data for the detection and quantification of natural selection.
Results: ImaGene enables genomic information from multiple individuals to be represented as abstract images. Each image is created by stacking aligned genomic data and encoding distinct alleles into separate colors. To detect and quantify signatures of positive selection, ImaGene implements a convolutional neural network which is trained using simulations. We show how the method implemented in ImaGene can be affected by data manipulation and learning strategies. In particular, we show how sorting images by row and column leads to accurate predictions. We also demonstrate how the misspecification of the correct demographic model for producing training data can influence the quantification of positive selection. We finally illustrate an approach to estimate the selection coefficient, a continuous variable, using multiclass classification techniques.
Conclusions: While the use of deep learning in evolutionary genomics is in its infancy, here we demonstrated its potential to detect informative patterns from large-scale genomic data. We implemented methods to process genomic data for deep learning in a user-friendly program called ImaGene. The joint inference of the evolutionary history of mutations and their functional impact will facilitate mapping studies and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with human phenotypes.},

              Strong genetic associations have been found for a number of psychiatric disorders. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              To address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain.
            
            
              RESULTS
              The base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from {\textasciitilde}32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals.
              From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; {\textasciitilde}79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and {\textasciitilde}2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising {\textasciitilde}238,000 linkage-disequilibrium–independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that {\textgreater}88\% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues.
              The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a {\textasciitilde}6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a {\textasciitilde}3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Our deep-learning model improves disease risk prediction over traditional approaches and can be extended with additional data types (e.g., microRNA and neuroimaging).
              
                
                  A comprehensive functional genomic resource for the adult human brain.
                  The resource forms a three-layer pyramid. The bottom layer includes sequencing datasets for traits, such as schizophrenia. The middle layer represents derived datasets, including functional genomic elements and QTLs. The top layer contains integrated models, which link genotypes to phenotypes. DSPN, Deep Structured Phenotype Network; PC1 and PC2, principal components 1 and 2; ref, reference; alt, alternate; H3K27ac, histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27.

            Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains {\textasciitilde}79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with {\textgreater}88\% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by {\textasciitilde}6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the most common repeated sequences in eukaryotic genomes. Recent studies demonstrated their deep impact on species diversity, adaptation to the environment and diseases. Although there are many conventional bioinformatics algorithms for detecting and classifying TEs, none have achieved reliable results on different types of TEs. Machine learning (ML) techniques can automatically extract hidden patterns and novel information from labeled or non-labeled data and have been applied to solving several scientiﬁc problems.
Methodology: We followed the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process, applying the six stages of the review protocol from it, but added a previous stage, which aims to detect the need for a review. Then search equations were formulated and executed in several literature databases. Relevant publications were scanned and used to extract evidence to answer research questions.
Results: Several ML approaches have already been tested on other bioinformatics problems with promising results, yet there are few algorithms and architectures available in literature focused speciﬁcally on TEs, despite representing the majority of the nuclear DNA of many organisms. Only 35 articles were found and categorized as relevant in TE or related ﬁelds.
Conclusions: ML is a powerful tool that can be used to address many problems. Although ML techniques have been used widely in other biological tasks, their utilization in TE analyses is still limited. Following the SLR, it was possible to notice that the use of ML for TE analyses (detection and classiﬁcation) is an open problem, and this new ﬁeld of research is growing in interest.},

            Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) are composed of consecutive repetitive DNA with hypervariable repeat count and composition. They include protein coding sequences and associations with clinical disorders. It has been difficult to incorporate VNTR analysis in disease studies that use short-read sequencing because the traditional approach of mapping to the human reference is less effective for repetitive and divergent sequences. In this work, we solve VNTR mapping for short reads with a repeat-pangenome graph (RPGG), a data structure that encodes both the population diversity and repeat structure of VNTR loci from multiple haplotype-resolved assemblies. We develop software to build a RPGG, and use the RPGG to estimate VNTR composition with short reads. We use this to discover VNTRs with length stratified by continental population, and expression quantitative trait loci, indicating that RPGG analysis of VNTRs will be critical for future studies of diversity and disease.},

              Genomes within a species often have a core, conserved component, as well as a variable set of genetic material among individuals or populations that is referred to as a “pangenome.” Inference of the relationships between pangenomes sequenced with short-read technology is often done computationally by mapping the sequences to a reference genome. The computational method affects genome assembly and comparisons, especially in cases of structural variants that are longer than an average sequenced region, for highly polymorphic loci, and for cross-species analyses. Siren
              et al
              . present a bioinformatic method called Giraffe, which improves mapping pangenomes in polymorphic regions of the genome containing single nucleotide polymorphisms and structural variants with standard computational resources, making large-scale genomic analyses more accessible. —LMZ
            
          , 
            A mapping algorithm named Giraffe has been developed to allow mapping of short-read sequences for thousands of genomes.
          , 
            
              INTRODUCTION
              Modern genomics depends on inexpensive short-read sequencing. Sequenced reads up to a few hundred base pairs in length are computationally mapped to estimated source locations in a reference genome. These read mappings are used in myriad sequencing-based assays. For example, through a process called genotyping, mapped reads from a DNA sample can be used to infer the combination of alleles present at each site in the reference genome.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              A single reference genome cannot capture the diversity within even a single person (who gets a genome copy from each parent), let alone in the whole human population. Genomes differ not only by point variations, where one or a few bases are different, but also by structural variations, where differences can be much larger than an individual read. When a person’s genome differs from the reference by a structural variation, the reference may contain no location to correctly map the corresponding reads. Although newer long-read sequencing allows structural variation to be more directly observed in sequencing reads, short-read sequencing is still less expensive and more widely available.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We present a short read–mapping tool, Giraffe. Giraffe maps to a pangenome reference that describes many genomes and the differences between them. Giraffe can accurately map reads to thousands of genomes embedded in a pangenome reference as quickly as existing tools map to a single reference genome. Simulations in which the true mapping for each read is known show that Giraffe is as accurate as the most accurate previously published tool. Giraffe achieves this speed and accuracy by using a variety of algorithmic techniques. In particular, and in contrast to previous tools, it focuses on mapping to the paths in the pangenome that are observed in individuals’ genomes: the reference haplotypes. This has two key benefits. First, it prioritizes alignments that are consistent with known sequences, avoiding combinations of alleles that are biologically unlikely. Second, it reduces the size of the problem by limiting the sequence space to which the reads could be aligned. This deals effectively with complex graph regions where most paths represent rare or nonexistent sequences.
              Using Giraffe in place of a single reference genome reduces mapping bias, which is the tendency to incorrectly map reads that differ from the reference genome. Combining Giraffe with state-of-the-art genotyping algorithms demonstrates that Giraffe mappings produce accurate genotyping results.
              Using mappings from Giraffe, we genotyped 167,000 recently discovered structural variations in short-read samples for 5202 people at an average computational cost of \$1.50 per sample. We present estimates for the frequency of different versions of these structural variations in the human population as a whole and within individual subpopulations. We identify thousands of these structural variations as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are associated with gene-expression levels.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Giraffe demonstrates the practicality of a pangenomic approach to short-read mapping. This approach allows short-read data to genotype single-nucleotide variations, short insertions and deletions, and structural variations more accurately. For structural variations, this allowed the estimation of population frequencies across a diverse cohort of 5000 individuals. A single reference genome must choose one version of any variation to represent, leaving the other versions unrepresented. By making more broadly representative pangenome references practical, Giraffe attempts to make genomics more inclusive.
              
                
                  Overview of the experiments.
                  Variant calls from long read–based and large-scale sequencing studies were used to construct pangenome reference graphs (top). Giraffe (and competing mappers) mapped reads to the graph or to linear references, and mapping accuracy, allele coverage balance, and speed were evaluated (middle). Then, mapped reads were used for variant calling, and variant call accuracy was evaluated (bottom). Structural variant calls were analyzed alongside expression data to identify eQTLs and population frequency estimates.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            We introduce Giraffe, a pangenome short-read mapper that can efficiently map to a collection of haplotypes threaded through a sequence graph. Giraffe maps sequencing reads to thousands of human genomes at a speed comparable to that of standard methods mapping to a single reference genome. The increased mapping accuracy enables downstream improvements in genome-wide genotyping pipelines for both small variants and larger structural variants. We used Giraffe to genotype 167,000 structural variants, discovered in long-read studies, in 5202 diverse human genomes that were sequenced using short reads. We conclude that pangenomics facilitates a more comprehensive characterization of variation and, as a result, has the potential to improve many genomic analyses.},

	abstract = {Background: It has been proposed that future reference genomes should be graph structures in order to better represent the sequence diversity present in a species. However, there is currently no standard method to represent genomic intervals, such as the positions of genes or transcription factor binding sites, on graph-based reference genomes.
Results: We formalize offset-based coordinate systems on graph-based reference genomes and introduce methods for representing intervals on these reference structures. We show the advantage of our methods by representing genes on a graph-based representation of the newest assembly of the human genome (GRCh38) and its alternative loci for regions that are highly variable.
Conclusion: More complex reference genomes, containing alternative loci, require methods to represent genomic data on these structures. Our proposed notation for genomic intervals makes it possible to fully utilize the alternative loci of the GRCh38 assembly and potential future graph-based reference genomes. We have made a Python package for representing such intervals on offset-based coordinate systems, available at https://github.com/uio-cels/ offsetbasedgraph. An interactive web-tool using this Python package to visualize genes on a graph created from GRCh38 is available at https://github.com/uio-cels/genomicgraphcoords.},

              Genome graphs
              can represent genetic variation and sequence uncertainty. Aligning sequences to genome graphs is key to many applications, including error correction, genome assembly, and genotyping of variants in a pangenome graph. Yet, so far, this step is often prohibitively slow. We present GraphAligner, a tool for aligning long reads to genome graphs. Compared to the state-of-the-art tools, GraphAligner is 13x faster and uses 3x less memory. When employing GraphAligner for error correction, we find it to be more than twice as accurate and over 12x faster than extant tools.Availability: Package manager:

Results: In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the problem of constructing, representing and navigating assembly graphs, focusing on very large datasets. We will also explore some computational techniques, such as the Bloom ﬁlter, to compactly store graphs while keeping all functionalities intact.
Conclusions: We complete our analysis with a discussion on the algorithmic issues of assembling from long reads (e.g., PacBio and Oxford Nanopore). Finally, we present some of the most relevant open problems in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Background: The increasing application of next generation sequencing technologies has led to the availability of thousands of reference genomes, often providing multiple genomes for the same or closely related species. The current approach to represent a species or a population with a single reference sequence and a set of variations cannot represent their full diversity and introduces bias towards the chosen reference. There is a need for the representation of multiple sequences in a composite way that is compatible with existing data sources for annotation and suitable for established sequence analysis methods. At the same time, this representation needs to be easily accessible and extendable to account for the constant change of available genomes.
Results: We introduce seq-seq-pan, a framework that provides methods for adding or removing new genomes from a set of aligned genomes and uses these to construct a whole genome alignment. Throughout the sequential workflow the alignment is optimized for generating a representative linear presentation of the aligned set of genomes, that enables its usage for annotation and in downstream analyses.
Conclusions: By providing dynamic updates and optimized processing, our approach enables the usage of whole genome alignment in the field of pan-genomics. In addition, the sequential workflow can be used as a fast alternative to existing whole genome aligners for aligning closely related genomes. seq-seq-pan is freely available at https://gitlab.com/rki\_bioinformatics},

	abstract = {Background: Typical human genome differs from the reference genome at 4-5 million sites. This diversity is increasingly catalogued in repositories such as ExAC/gnomAD, consisting of {\textgreater}15,000 whole-genomes and {\textgreater}126,000 exome sequences from different individuals. Despite this enormous diversity, resequencing data workflows are still based on a single human reference genome. Identification and genotyping of genetic variants is typically carried out on short-read data aligned to a single reference, disregarding the underlying variation.
Results: We propose a new unified framework for variant calling with short-read data utilizing a representation of human genetic variation – a pan-genomic reference. We provide a modular pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing sequencing data analysis workflows. Our tool is open source and available online: https://gitlab.com/dvalenzu/PanVC.
Conclusions: Our experiments show that by replacing a standard human reference with a pan-genomic one we achieve an improvement in single-nucleotide variant calling accuracy and in short indel calling accuracy over the widely adopted Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) in difficult genomic regions.},

	abstract = {Background: During the last decade, the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) sequence has become a powerful tool for the study of past human populations. However, the degraded nature of aDNA means that aDNA molecules are short and frequently mutated by post-mortem chemical modifications. These features decrease read mapping accuracy and increase reference bias, in which reads containing non-reference alleles are less likely to be mapped than those containing reference alleles. Alternative approaches have been developed to replace the linear reference with a variation graph which includes known alternative variants at each genetic locus. Here, we evaluate the use of variation graph software vg to avoid reference bias for aDNA and compare with existing methods.
Results: We use vg to align simulated and real aDNA samples to a variation graph containing 1000 Genome Project variants and compare with the same data aligned with bwa to the human linear reference genome. Using vg leads to a balanced allelic representation at polymorphic sites, effectively removing reference bias, and more sensitive variant detection in comparison with bwa, especially for insertions and deletions (indels). Alternative approaches that use relaxed bwa parameter settings or filter bwa alignments can also reduce bias but can have lower sensitivity than vg, particularly for indels.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that aligning aDNA sequences to variation graphs effectively mitigates the impact of reference bias when analyzing aDNA, while retaining mapping sensitivity and allowing detection of variation, in particular indel variation, that was previously missed.},

              New genome assemblies have been arriving at a rapidly increasing pace, thanks to decreases in sequencing costs and improvements in third-generation sequencing technologies
              1–3
              . For example, the number of vertebrate genome assemblies currently in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database
              4
              increased by more than 50\% to 1,485 assemblies in the year from July 2018 to July 2019. In addition to this influx of assemblies from different species, new human de novo assemblies
              5
              are being produced, which enable the analysis of not only small polymorphisms, but also complex, large-scale structural differences between human individuals and haplotypes. This coming era and its unprecedented amount of data offer the opportunity to uncover many insights into genome evolution but also present challenges in how to adapt current analysis methods to meet the increased scale. Cactus
              6
              , a reference-free multiple genome alignment program, has been shown to be highly accurate, but the existing implementation scales poorly with increasing numbers of genomes, and struggles in regions of highly duplicated sequences. Here we describe progressive extensions to Cactus to create Progressive Cactus, which enables the reference-free alignment of tens to thousands of large vertebrate genomes while maintaining high alignment quality. We describe results from an alignment of more than 600 amniote genomes, which is to our knowledge the largest multiple vertebrate genome alignment created so far.},

	abstract = {Background: DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification, which is involved in many biological processes, including gene expression regulation, embryonic development, cell differentiation and genomic imprinting etc. And it also involves many key regulatory genes in eukaryotes. By tracing the evolutionary history of methylation-related genes, we can understand the origin and expansion time of these genes, which helps to understand the evolutionary history of plants, and we can also understand the changes of DNA methylation patterns in different species. However, most studies on the evolution of methylation-related genes failed to be carried out for the whole DNA methylation pathway.
Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive identification of 33 methylation-related genes in 77 species, and investigated gene origin and evolution throughout the plant kingdom. We found that the origin of genes responsible for methylation maintenance and demethylation evolved early, while most de novo methylation-related genes appeared late. The methylation-related genes were expanded by whole genome duplication and tandem replication, but were also accompanied by a large number of gene absence events in different species. The gene length and intron length varied a lot in different species, but exon structure and functional domains were relatively conserved. The phylogenetic relationships of methylation-related genes were traced to reveal the evolution history of DNA methylation in different species. The expression patterns of methylation-related genes have changed during the evolution of species, and the expression patterns of these genes in different species can be clustered into four categories.
Conclusions: The study describes a global characterization of DNA methylation-related genes in the plant kingdom. The similarities and differences in origin time, gene structure and phylogenetic relationship of these genes lead us to understand the evolutionary conservation and dynamics of DNA methylation in plants.},

              Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) is established by small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Maintenance of silencing is then based on a combination of RdDM and RNA-independent mechanisms involving DNA methyltransferase MET1 and chromodomain DNA methyltransferases (CMTs). Involvement of RdDM, according to this model should decrease with TE age but here we show a different pattern in tomato and
              Arabidopsis
              . In these species the CMTs silence long terminal repeat (LTR) transposons in the distal chromatin that are younger than those affected by RdDM. To account for these findings we propose that, after establishment of primary RdDM as in the original model, there is an RNA-independent maintenance phase involving CMTs followed by secondary RdDM. This progression of epigenetic silencing in the gene-rich distal chromatin is likely to influence the transcriptome either in
              cis
              or in
              trans
              depending on whether the mechanisms are RNA-dependent or -independent.},

              Deep learning models have shown great promise in predicting regulatory effects from DNA sequence, but their informativeness for human complex diseases is not fully understood. Here, we evaluate genome-wide SNP annotations from two previous deep learning models, DeepSEA and Basenji, by applying stratified LD score regression to 41 diseases and traits (average
              N
               = 320K), conditioning on a broad set of coding, conserved and regulatory annotations. We aggregated annotations across all (respectively blood or brain) tissues/cell-types in meta-analyses across all (respectively 11 blood or 8 brain) traits. The annotations were highly enriched for disease heritability, but produced only limited conditionally significant results: non-tissue-specific and brain-specific Basenji-H3K4me3 for all traits and brain traits respectively. We conclude that deep learning models have yet to achieve their full potential to provide considerable unique information for complex disease, and that their conditional informativeness for disease cannot be inferred from their accuracy in predicting regulatory annotations.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Crop genomes can be very large, with many repetitive elements and pseudogenes. Distilling a genome down to the relatively small fraction of regions that are functionally valuable for trait variation can be like looking for needles in a haystack. The location of these regions is often not obvious, and current detection technologies are impractically expensive and intensive for many research projects. The unmethylated regions in a genome are highly stable during vegetative development and can reveal the locations of potentially expressed genes or cis-regulatory elements. This approach provides a framework toward complete annotation of genes and discovery of cis-regulatory elements using methylation profiles from only a single tissue.

            The genomic sequences of crops continue to be produced at a frenetic pace. It remains challenging to develop complete annotations of functional genes and regulatory elements in these genomes. Chromatin accessibility assays enable discovery of functional elements; however, to uncover the full portfolio of cis-elements would require profiling of many combinations of cell types, tissues, developmental stages, and environments. Here, we explore the potential to use DNA methylation profiles to develop more complete annotations. Using leaf tissue in maize, we define ∼100,000 unmethylated regions (UMRs) that account for 5.8\% of the genome; 33,375 UMRs are found greater than 2 kb from genes. UMRs are highly stable in multiple vegetative tissues, and they capture the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions from leaf tissue. However, many UMRs are not accessible in leaf, and these represent regions with potential to become accessible in specific cell types or developmental stages. These UMRs often occur near genes that are expressed in other tissues and are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors. The leaf-inaccessible UMRs exhibit unique chromatin modification patterns and are enriched for chromatin interactions with nearby genes. The total UMR space in four additional monocots ranges from 80 to 120 megabases, which is remarkably similar considering the range in genome size of 271 megabases to 4.8 gigabases. In summary, based on the profile from a single tissue, DNA methylation signatures provide powerful filters to distill large genomes down to the small fraction of putative functional genes and regulatory elements.},

              DNA methylation is a ubiquitous chromatin feature, present in 25\% of cytosines in the maize genome, but variation and evolution of the methylation landscape during maize domestication remain largely unknown. Here, we leverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data on populations of modern maize, landrace, and teosinte (

              to estimate epimutation rates and selection coefficients. We find weak evidence for direct selection on DNA methylation in any context, but thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are identified population-wide that are correlated with recent selection.

              -DMR, HiChIP data indicate that the interactive loops between DMRs and respective downstream genes are present in B73, a modern maize line, but absent in teosinte. Our results enable a better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on patterns of DNA methylation and suggest a role of methylation variation in adaptive evolution.},

            As consequence of the various genomic sequencing projects, an increasing volume of biological sequence data is being produced. Although machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of genomic sequence-related problems, the results are largely affected by the type and number of features extracted. This effect has motivated new algorithms and pipeline proposals, mainly involving feature extraction problems, in which extracting significant discriminatory information from a biological set is challenging. Considering this, our work proposes a new study of feature extraction approaches based on mathematical features (numerical mapping with Fourier, entropy and complex networks). As a case study, we analyze long non-coding RNA sequences. Moreover, we separated this work into three studies. First, we assessed our proposal with the most addressed problem in our review, e.g. lncRNA and mRNA; second, we also validate the mathematical features in different classification problems, to predict the class of lncRNA, e.g. circular RNAs sequences; third, we analyze its robustness in scenarios with imbalanced data. The experimental results demonstrated three main contributions: first, an in-depth study of several mathematical features; second, a new feature extraction pipeline; and third, its high performance and robustness for distinct RNA sequence classification.

              Essential genes are critical for the growth and survival of any organism. The machine learning approach complements the experimental methods to minimize the resources required for essentiality assays. Previous studies revealed the need to discover relevant features that significantly classify essential genes, improve on the generalizability of prediction models across organisms, and construct a robust gold standard as the class label for the train data to enhance prediction. Findings also show that a significant limitation of the machine learning approach is predicting conditionally essential genes. The essentiality status of a gene can change due to a specific condition of the organism. This review examines various methods applied to essential gene prediction task, their strengths, limitations and the factors responsible for effective computational prediction of essential genes. We discussed categories of features and how they contribute to the classification performance of essentiality prediction models. Five categories of features, namely, gene sequence, protein sequence, network topology, homology and gene ontology-based features, were generated for Caenorhabditis elegans to perform a comparative analysis of their essentiality prediction capacity. Gene ontology-based feature category outperformed other categories of features majorly due to its high correlation with the genes’ biological functions. However, the topology feature category provided the highest discriminatory power making it more suitable for essentiality prediction. The major limiting factor of machine learning to predict essential genes conditionality is the unavailability of labeled data for interest conditions that can train a classifier. Therefore, cooperative machine learning could further exploit models that can perform well in conditional essentiality predictions.
            
            
              Short abstract
              Identification of essential genes is imperative because it provides an understanding of the core structure and function, accelerating drug targets’ discovery, among other functions. Recent studies have applied machine learning to complement the experimental identification of essential genes. However, several factors are limiting the performance of machine learning approaches. This review aims to present the standard procedure and resources available for predicting essential genes in organisms, and also highlight the factors responsible for the current limitation in using machine learning for conditional gene essentiality prediction. The choice of features and ML technique was identified as an important factor to predict essential genes effectively.},

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the ways that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), methodologies can inform patient care during pregnancy and improve outcomes. Materials and methods: We searched English articles on EMBASE, PubMed and SCOPUS. Search terms included ML, AI, pregnancy and informatics. We included research articles and book chapters, excluding conference papers, editorials and notes.
Results: We identified 127 distinct studies from our queries that were relevant to our topic and included in the review. We found that supervised learning methods were more popular (n = 69) than unsupervised methods (n = 9). Popular methods included support vector machines (n = 30), artificial neural networks (n = 22), regression analysis (n = 17) and random forests (n = 16). Methods such as DL are beginning to gain traction (n = 13). Common areas within the pregnancy domain where AI and ML methods were used the most include prenatal care (e.g. fetal anomalies, placental functioning) (n = 73); perinatal care, birth and delivery (n = 20); and preterm birth (n = 13). Efforts to translate AI into clinical care include clinical decision support systems (n = 24) and mobile health applications (n = 9).
Conclusions: Overall, we found that ML and AI methods are being employed to optimize pregnancy outcomes, including modern DL methods (n = 13). Future research should focus on less-studied pregnancy domain areas, including postnatal and postpartum care (n = 2). Also, more work on clinical adoption of AI methods and the ethical implications of such adoption is needed.},

              INTRODUCTION
              Epigenetic modifications to chromatin, such as the methylation of DNA cytosines, carry regulatory information across the generations in plants and animals. Epigenetic marks are inherited through germlines, which can undergo epigenetic reprogramming that affects germline function. Mammalian germlines undergo genome-wide demethylation and remethylation, which resets epigenetic marks and restores cellular pluripotency. Germlines of flowering plants differentiate later than those of mammals and undergo distinct DNA methylation reprogramming. Global methylation level changes have been observed in plant germ cells, as well as local de novo methylation that regulates germline gene expression. However, the reprogramming mechanism remains unclear, which limits the understanding of tissue-specific and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                De novo methylation of genes in the
                Arabidopsis
                male germline is catalyzed by the small RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (RdDM). RdDM uses 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from a source locus, typically a transposon, to guide methyltransferases to methylate the cognate region. RdDM is ubiquitous among cells and normally methylates transposons. We investigated how RdDM targets genes in the germline, how such reprogramming is limited to the germline, and how the hundreds of target genes are selected.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                We show that in
                Arabidopsis
                , germline-specific methylation at hundreds of genes is established by 24-nt siRNAs transcribed from hypermethylated transposons with imperfect sequence homology. CRISPR deletion of siRNA source transposons abolishes DNA methylation at corresponding genes in male meiocytes, demonstrating the ability of these siRNAs to target methylation in trans with mismatches. Furthermore, we found that meiocytes are quiescent in 24-nt siRNA biogenesis, and the gene targeting siRNAs are produced in tapetal nurse cells and transported into meiocytes. The siRNA profile of tapetal cells resembles that of meiocytes, suggesting bulk siRNA movement through the cytoplasmic channels (known as plasmodesmata) that connect these cells during early meiosis. Although gene-targeting siRNAs accumulate to levels in the tapetum comparable with those in meiocytes, the target genes are not methylated in the tapetum, showing that meiocytes can use imperfectly matching siRNAs to target DNA methylation.
              
              
                We also show that the biogenesis of gene-targeting siRNAs in the tapetum is driven by a putative chromatin remodeler, CLASSY3 (CLSY3). CLSY3 is absent in vegetative tissues but enriched in female and male organs. In male organs, CLSY3 is specifically expressed in tapetal cells. The
                clsy3
                mutation eliminates de novo methylation at genes in male meiocytes as well as sperm, revealing the role of tapetal siRNAs in driving methylation reprogramming throughout the male germline. This conclusion was reinforced with experiments with a genetic mosaic system that restricted siRNA biogenesis to the tapetum. In the mosaic lines, tapetal siRNAs restore methylation in the male germline at genes specifically methylated in the germline and at transposons targeted by RdDM in all tissues. This shows that tapetal siRNAs shape the full spectrum of RNA-directed DNA methylation throughout the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm.
              
              
                As tapetal siRNAs induce methylation at transposons in the male germline, we investigated whether these siRNAs serve to silence germline transposons in addition to their gene regulatory function. We found that tapetal siRNAs methylate and prevent the expression of a Gypsy retrotransposon (
                GP1
                ) that is specifically active in reproductive cells, demonstrating that tapetal siRNAs ensure germline genome integrity by suppressing transposons.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our work reveals the role of tapetum-derived 24-nt siRNAs in determining the paternal methylome. Tapetal siRNAs drive de novo methylation at genes in the germline and safeguard genome integrity by silencing transposons. The ability of meiocytes to use mismatched 24-nt siRNAs to induce methylation allows RdDM to target sequences similar to those of transposons that produce siRNAs in the tapetum. This should facilitate recognition and silencing of new transposons, indicating that meiosis is a key stage for genome surveillance and allows RdDM to specifically regulate germline gene expression. The broad targeting competence of tapetal siRNAs resembles that of metazoan gonad-expressed Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), suggesting convergent evolution of specialized small RNA pathways to control transposons and genes in plant and animal germlines.
              
                
                  Tapetal siRNAs shape germline DNA methylation.
                  RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) transcripts are processed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) and Dicer-Like 3 (DCL3) into 24-nt siRNAs. Tapetal siRNAs are transcribed from transposons, enabled by CLSY3 expression. Tapetal siRNAs move to meiocytes and induce methylation at corresponding transposons and genes with similar sequences. This genic methylation is germline-specific, indicating that the siRNA-targeted de novo methylation pathway is hypersensitive in meiocytes.

            The plant male germline undergoes DNA methylation reprogramming, which methylates genes de novo and thereby alters gene expression and regulates meiosis. Here, we reveal the molecular mechanism underlying this reprogramming. We demonstrate that genic methylation in the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm, is established by 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from transposons with imperfect sequence homology. These siRNAs are synthesized by meiocyte nurse cells (tapetum) through activity of CLSY3, a chromatin remodeler absent in other anther cells. Tapetal siRNAs govern germline methylation throughout the genome, including the inherited methylation patterns in sperm. Tapetum-derived siRNAs also silence germline transposons, safeguarding genome integrity. Our results reveal that tapetal siRNAs are sufficient to reconstitute germline methylation patterns and drive functional methylation reprogramming throughout the male germline.},

              By RNA profiling of 10 stages of maize anthers plus mature pollen, we found two distinct classes of phased small-interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs): 21-nt premeiotic phasiRNAs, after germinal and somatic cell specification, and 24-nt meiotic phasiRNAs coordinately accumulated during meiosis and persist into pollen. Sequencing of RNA from five male-sterile, anther developmental mutants—

              , and
              ameiotic1
              —demonstrated the involvement of specific somatic layers. Premeiotic phasiRNAs require a functional epidermis, whereas meiotic phasiRNAs require a normal tapetum. Mammalian germ cells express “prepachytene” or “pachytene” PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Whereas differences in biogenesis indicate independent origins, grass phasiRNAs and mammalian piRNAs share developmental timing, a lack of obvious targets, and an impact on male fertility, suggesting a possible evolutionary convergence.
            
          , 
            
              Maize anthers, the male reproductive floral organs, express two classes of phased small-interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). PhasiRNA precursors are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and map to low-copy, intergenic regions similar to PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in mammalian testis. From 10 sequential cohorts of staged maize anthers plus mature pollen we find that 21-nt phased siRNAs from 463 loci appear abruptly after germinal and initial somatic cell fate specification and then diminish, whereas 24-nt phasiRNAs from 176 loci coordinately accumulate during meiosis and persist as anther somatic cells mature and haploid gametophytes differentiate into pollen. Male-sterile
              ocl4
              anthers defective in epidermal signaling lack 21-nt phasiRNAs. Male-sterile mutants with subepidermal defects—
              mac1
              (excess meiocytes),
              ms23
              (defective pretapetal cells), and
              msca1
              (no normal soma or meiocytes)—lack 24-nt phasiRNAs.
              ameiotic1
              mutants (normal soma, no meiosis) accumulate both 21-nt and 24-nt phasiRNAs, ruling out meiotic cells as a source or regulator of phasiRNA biogenesis. By in situ hybridization, miR2118 triggers of 21-nt phasiRNA biogenesis localize to epidermis; however, 21-
              PHAS
              precursors and 21-nt phasiRNAs are abundant subepidermally. The miR2275 trigger, 24-
              PHAS
              precursors, and 24-nt phasiRNAs all accumulate preferentially in tapetum and meiocytes. Therefore, each phasiRNA type exhibits independent spatiotemporal regulation with 21-nt premeiotic phasiRNAs dependent on epidermal and 24-nt meiotic phasiRNAs dependent on tapetal cell differentiation. Maize phasiRNAs and mammalian piRNAs illustrate putative convergent evolution of small RNAs in male reproduction.},

	abstract = {Background:  Several examples of structural variation (SV) affecting phenotypic traits have been reported in cattle. Currently the identification of SV from whole-genome sequence data (WGS) suffers from a high false positive rate. Our aim was to construct a high quality set of SV calls in cattle using WGS data. First, we tested two SV detection programs, Breakdancer and Pindel, and the overlap of these methods, on simulated sequence data to determine their precision and sensitivity. We then identified population SV from WGS of 252 Holstein and 64 Jersey bulls based on the overlapping calls from the two programs. In addition, we validated an overlapped SV set in 28 twice-sequenced Holstein individuals, and in another two validated sets (one for each breed) that were transmitted from sire to son. We also tested whether highly conserved gene sets across eukaryotes and recently expanded gene families in bovine were depleted and enriched, respectively, for SV.
Results:  In empirical WGS data, 17,518 SV covering 27.36 Mb were found in the Holstein population and 4285 SV covering 8.74 Mb in the Jersey population, of which 4.62 Mb of SV overlapped between Holsteins and Jerseys. A total of 11,534 candidate SV covering 5.64 Mb were validated in the 28 twice-sequenced individuals, while 3.49 and 0.67 Mb of SV were validated from Holstein and Jersey sire-son transmission, respectively. Only eight of 237 core eukaryotic genes had at least a 50-bp overlap with an SV from our validated sets, suggesting that conserved genes are depleted for SV (p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, we observed that recently expanded gene families were significantly more associated with SV than other genes. Long interspersed nuclear elements-1 were enriched for deletions when compared to the rest of the genome (p = 0.0035).
Conclusions:  We reported SV from 252 Holstein and 64 Jersey individuals. A considerable proportion of Jersey population SV (53.5\%) were also found in Holstein. In contrast, about 76.90\% sire-son transmission validated SV were present in Jerseys and Holsteins. The enrichment of SV in expanding gene families suggests that SV can be a source of genetic variation for evolution.},

	abstract = {Background: Structural variations (SVs) or copy number variations (CNVs) greatly impact the functions of the genes encoded in the genome and are responsible for diverse human diseases. Although a number of existing SV detection algorithms can detect many types of SVs using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, no single algorithm can call every type of SVs with high precision and high recall.
Results: We comprehensively evaluate the performance of 69 existing SV detection algorithms using multiple simulated and real WGS datasets. The results highlight a subset of algorithms that accurately call SVs depending on specific types and size ranges of the SVs and that accurately determine breakpoints, sizes, and genotypes of the SVs. We enumerate potential good algorithms for each SV category, among which GRIDSS, Lumpy, SVseq2, SoftSV, Manta, and Wham are better algorithms in deletion or duplication categories. To improve the accuracy of SV calling, we systematically evaluate the accuracy of overlapping calls between possible combinations of algorithms for every type and size range of SVs. The results demonstrate that both the precision and recall for overlapping calls vary depending on the combinations of specific algorithms rather than the combinations of methods used in the algorithms.
Conclusion: These results suggest that careful selection of the algorithms for each type and size range of SVs is required for accurate calling of SVs. The selection of specific pairs of algorithms for overlapping calls promises to effectively improve the SV detection accuracy.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Large-scale initiatives toward personalized medicine are driving a massive expansion in the number of human genomes being sequenced. Therefore, there is an urgent need to define quality standards for clinical use. This includes deep coverage and sequencing accuracy of an individual’s genome. Our work represents the largest effort to date in sequencing human genomes at deep coverage with these new standards. This study identifies over 150 million human variants, a majority of them rare and unknown. Moreover, these data identify sites in the genome that are highly intolerant to variation—possibly essential for life or health. We conclude that high-coverage genome sequencing provides accurate detail on human variation for discovery and clinical applications.
          , 
            We report on the sequencing of 10,545 human genomes at 30×–40× coverage with an emphasis on quality metrics and novel variant and sequence discovery. We find that 84\% of an individual human genome can be sequenced confidently. This high-confidence region includes 91.5\% of exon sequence and 95.2\% of known pathogenic variant positions. We present the distribution of over 150 million single-nucleotide variants in the coding and noncoding genome. Each newly sequenced genome contributes an average of 8,579 novel variants. In addition, each genome carries on average 0.7 Mb of sequence that is not found in the main build of the hg38 reference genome. The density of this catalog of variation allowed us to construct high-resolution profiles that define genomic sites that are highly intolerant of genetic variation. These results indicate that the data generated by deep genome sequencing is of the quality necessary for clinical use.},

	abstract = {Background: Organisms need to adapt to keep pace with a changing environment. Examining recent range expansion aids our understanding of how organisms evolve to overcome environmental constraints. However, how organisms adapt to climate changes is a crucial biological question that is still largely unanswered. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an excellent system to study this fundamental question. Its origin is in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, but it has spread to the Far East, including the most south-eastern edge of its native habitats, the Yangtze River basin, where the climate is very different.
Results: We sequenced 118 A. thaliana strains from the region surrounding the Yangtze River basin. We found that the Yangtze River basin population is a unique population and diverged about 61,409 years ago, with gene flows occurring at two different time points, followed by a population dispersion into the Yangtze River basin in the last few thousands of years. Positive selection analyses revealed that biological regulation processes, such as flowering time, immune and defense response processes could be correlated with the adaptation event. In particular, we found that the flowering time gene SVP has contributed to A. thaliana adaptation to the Yangtze River basin based on genetic mapping.
Conclusions: A. thaliana adapted to the Yangtze River basin habitat by promoting the onset of flowering, a finding that sheds light on how a species can adapt to locales with very different climates.},

              Maize as a staple food crop in temperate North America required adaptation to a shorter growing season. On its first introduction in the southwestern United States ∼4000 years ago, maize was extensively grown in the lowlands. Cultivation in the temperate uplands did not occur for another 2000 years. Swarts
              et al.
              used ancient DNA data from 1900-year-old maize cobs found in a temperate cave in the southwestern United States and mapped the ancient flowering phenotype. The ancient maize samples were marginally adapted to temperate regions as a result of selection on standing variation.

            Archaeological maize found in ancient turkey pens was adapted to temperate environments by 1900 years ago.
          , 
            By 4000 years ago, people had introduced maize to the southwestern United States; full agriculture was established quickly in the lowland deserts but delayed in the temperate highlands for 2000 years. We test if the earliest upland maize was adapted for early flowering, a characteristic of modern temperate maize. We sequenced fifteen 1900-year-old maize cobs from Turkey Pen Shelter in the temperate Southwest. Indirectly validated genomic models predicted that Turkey Pen maize was marginally adapted with respect to flowering, as well as short, tillering, and segregating for yellow kernel color. Temperate adaptation drove modern population differentiation and was selected in situ from ancient standing variation. Validated prediction of polygenic traits improves our understanding of ancient phenotypes and the dynamics of environmental adaptation.},

	abstract = {One of the most striking patterns of genome structure is the tight, typically negative, association between transposable elements (TEs) and meiotic recombination rates. While this is a highly recurring feature of eukaryotic genomes, the mechanisms driving correlations between TEs and recombination remain poorly understood, and distinguishing cause versus effect is challenging. Here, we review the evidence for a relation between TEs and recombination, and discuss the underlying evolutionary forces. Evidence to date suggests that overall TE densities correlate negatively with recombination, but the strength of this correlation varies across element types, and the pattern can be reversed. Results suggest that heterogeneity in the strength of selection against ectopic recombination and gene disruption can drive TE accumulation in regions of low recombination, but there is also strong evidence that the regulation of TEs can influence local recombination rates. We hypothesize that TE insertion polymorphism may be important in driving within-species variation in recombination rates in surrounding genomic regions. Furthermore, the interaction between TEs and recombination may create positive feedback, whereby TE accumulation in non-recombining regions contributes to the spread of recombination suppression. Further investigation of the coevolution between recombination and TEs has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of recombination rates and genome structure.

              Malaria is caused by eukaryotic
              Plasmodium
              spp. parasites that classically infect red blood cells. These are difficult organisms to investigate genetically because of their AT-rich genomes. Zhang
              et al.
              have exploited this peculiarity by using
              piggyBac
              transposon insertion sites to achieve saturation-level mutagenesis for identifying and ranking essential genes and drug targets (see the Perspective by White and Rathod). Genes that are current candidates for drug targets were identified as essential, in contrast to many vaccine target genes. Notably, the proteasome degradation pathway was confirmed as a target for developing therapeutic interventions because of the several essential genes involved and the link to the mechanism of action of the current frontline drug, artemisinin.

            Mutagenesis of a human malaria parasite reveals a core set of genes essential for asexual growth in red blood cells in vitro.

              INTRODUCTION
              
                Malaria remains a devastating global parasitic disease, with the majority of malaria deaths caused by the highly virulent
                Plasmodium falciparum
                . The extreme AT-bias of the
                P. falciparum
                genome has hampered genetic studies through targeted approaches such as homologous recombination or CRISPR-Cas9, and only a few hundred
                P. falciparum
                mutants have been experimentally generated in the past decades. In this study, we have used high-throughput
                piggyBac
                transposon insertional mutagenesis and quantitative insertion site sequencing (QIseq) to reach saturation-level mutagenesis of this parasite.
              
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                Our study exploits the AT-richness of the
                P. falciparum
                genome, which provides numerous
                piggyBac
                transposon insertion targets within both gene coding and noncoding flanking sequences, to generate more than 38,000
                P. falciparum
                mutants. At this level of mutagenesis, we could distinguish essential genes as nonmutable and dispensable genes as mutable. Subsequently, we identified 2680 genes essential for in vitro asexual blood-stage growth.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                We calculated mutagenesis index scores (MISs) and mutagenesis fitness scores (MFSs) in order to functionally define the relative fitness cost of disruption for 5399 genes. A competitive growth phenotype screen confirmed that MIS and MFS were predictive of the fitness cost for in vitro asexual growth. Genes predicted to be essential included genes implicated in drug resistance—such as the “
                K13
                ” Kelch propeller,
                mdr
                , and
                dhfr-ts
                —as well as targets considered to be high value for drugs development, such as
                pkg
                and
                cdpk5
                . The screen revealed essential genes that are specific to human
                Plasmodium
                parasites but absent from rodent-infective species, such as lipid metabolic genes that may be crucial to transmission commitment in human infections. MIS and MFS profiling provides a clear ranking of the relative essentiality of gene ontology (GO) functions in
                P. falciparum
                . GO pathways associated with translation, RNA metabolism, and cell cycle control are more essential, whereas genes associated with protein phosphorylation, virulence factors, and transcription are more likely to be dispensable. Last, we confirm that the proteasome-degradation pathway is a high-value druggable target on the basis of its high ratio of essential to dispensable genes, and by functionally confirming its link to the mode of action of artemisinin, the current front-line antimalarial.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                Saturation-scale mutagenesis allows prioritization of intervention targets in the genome of the most important cause of malaria. The identification of more than 2680 essential genes, including {\textasciitilde}1000
                Plasmodium
                -conserved essential genes, will be valuable for antimalarial therapeutic research.

              Severe malaria is caused by the apicomplexan parasite
              Plasmodium falciparum.
              Despite decades of research, the distinct biology of these parasites has made it challenging to establish high-throughput genetic approaches to identify and prioritize therapeutic targets. Using transposon mutagenesis of
              P. falciparum
              in an approach that exploited its AT-rich genome, we generated more than 38,000 mutants, saturating the genome and defining mutability and fitness costs for over 87\% of genes. Of 5399 genes, our study defined 2680 genes as essential for optimal growth of asexual blood stages in vitro. These essential genes are associated with drug resistance, represent leading vaccine candidates, and include approximately 1000
              Plasmodium
              -conserved genes of unknown function. We validated this approach by testing proteasome pathways for individual mutants associated with artemisinin sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Background: Recently, alignment-free sequence analysis methods have gained popularity in the field of personal genomics. These methods are based on counting frequencies of short k-mer sequences, thus allowing faster and more robust analysis compared to traditional alignment-based methods.
Results: We have created a fast alignment-free method, AluMine, to analyze polymorphic insertions of Alu elements in the human genome. We tested the method on 2,241 individuals from the Estonian Genome Project and identified 28,962 potential polymorphic Alu element insertions. Each tested individual had on average 1,574 Alu element insertions that were different from those in the reference genome. In addition, we propose an alignment-free genotyping method that uses the frequency of insertion/deletion-specific 32-mer pairs to call the genotype directly from raw sequencing reads. Using this method, the concordance between the predicted and experimentally observed genotypes was 98.7\%. The running time of the discovery pipeline is approximately 2 h per individual. The genotyping of potential polymorphic insertions takes between 0.4 and 4 h per individual, depending on the hardware configuration.
Conclusions: AluMine provides tools that allow discovery of novel Alu element insertions and/or genotyping of known Alu element insertions from personal genomes within few hours.},

            Tomatoes come in a multitude of shapes and flavors despite a narrow genetic pool. Here, we leverage whole-genome resequencing data available for 602 cultivated and wild accessions to determine the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to tomato diversity. We identify 6,906 TE insertions polymorphisms (TIPs), which result from the mobilization of 337 distinct TE families. Most TIPs are low frequency variants and TIPs are disproportionately located within or adjacent to genes involved in environmental responses. In addition, genic TE insertions tend to have strong transcriptional effects and they can notably lead to the generation of multiple transcript isoforms. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identify at least 40 TIPs robustly associated with extreme variation in major agronomic traits or secondary metabolites and in most cases, no SNP tags the TE insertion allele. Collectively, these findings highlight the unique role of TE mobilization in tomato diversification, with important implications for breeding.},

	abstract = {We initially analyzed 11 families of low- and middle-copy-number long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in rice to determine how their structures have diverged from their predicted ancestral forms. These elements, many highly fragmented, were identified on the basis of sequence homology and structural characteristics. The 11 families, totaling 1000 elements, have copy numbers ranging from 1 to 278. Less than one-quarter of these elements are intact, whereas the remaining are solo LTRs and variously truncated fragments. We also analyzed two highly repetitive families (
              Osr8
              and
              Osr30
              ) of LTR retrotransposons and observed the same results. Our data indicate that unequal homologous recombination and illegitimate recombination are primarily responsible for LTR-retrotransposon removal. Further analysis suggests that most of the detectable LTR retrotransposons in rice inserted less than 8 million years ago, and have now lost over two-thirds of their encoded sequences. Hence, we predict that the half-life of LTR-retrotransposon sequences in rice is less than 6 million years. Moreover, our data demonstrate that at least 22\% (97 Mb) of the current rice genome is comprised of LTR-retrotransposon sequences, and that more than 190 Mb of LTR-retrotransposon sequences have been deleted from the rice genome in the last 8 million years.},

              It took more than three decades—and a Nobel Prize in 1983—for Barbara McClintock's discovery of transposition and mobile genetic elements to become widely accepted. However, her vision of transposons as “controlling elements” and architects of genome organization has remained controversial. On page 846 of this issue, a report by Ellison and Bachtrog brings McClintock's prescient ideas back to center stage (

	abstract = {Background: Of the different bioinformatic methods used to recover transposable elements (TEs) in genome sequences, one of the most commonly used procedures is the homology-based method proposed by the RepeatMasker program. RepeatMasker generates several output files, including the .out file, which provides annotations for all detected repeats in a query sequence. However, a remaining challenge consists of identifying the different copies of TEs that correspond to the identified hits. This step is essential for any evolutionary/comparative analysis of the different copies within a family. Different possibilities can lead to multiple hits corresponding to a unique copy of an element, such as the presence of large deletions/insertions or undetermined bases, and distinct consensus corresponding to a single full-length sequence (like for long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons). These possibilities must be taken into account to determine the exact number of TE copies.
Results: We have developed a perl tool that parses the RepeatMasker .out file to better determine the number and positions of TE copies in the query sequence, in addition to computing quantitative information for the different families. To determine the accuracy of the program, we tested it on several RepeatMasker .out files corresponding to two organisms (Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens) for which the TE content has already been largely described and which present great differences in genome size, TE content, and TE families.
Conclusions: Our tool provides access to detailed information concerning the TE content in a genome at the family level from the .out file of RepeatMasker. This information includes the exact position and orientation of each copy, its proportion in the query sequence, and its quality compared to the reference element. In addition, our tool allows a user to directly retrieve the sequence of each copy and obtain the same detailed information at the family level when a local library with incomplete TE class/subclass information was used with RepeatMasker. We hope that this tool will be helpful for people working on the distribution and evolution of TEs within genomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Transposable elements constitute an important part of the genome and are essential in adaptive mechanisms. Transposition events associated with phenotypic changes occur naturally or are induced in insertional mutant populations. Transposon mutagenesis results in multiple random insertions and recovery of most/all the insertions is critical for forward genetics study. Using genome next-generation sequencing data and appropriate bioinformatics tool, it is plausible to accurately identify transposon insertion sites, which could provide candidate causal mutations for desired phenotypes for further functional validation.
Results: We developed a novel bioinformatics tool, ITIS (Identification of Transposon Insertion Sites), for localizing transposon insertion sites within a genome. It takes next-generation genome re-sequencing data (NGS data), transposon sequence, and reference genome sequence as input, and generates a list of highly reliable candidate insertion sites as well as zygosity information of each insertion. Using a simulated dataset and a case study based on an insertional mutant line from Medicago truncatula, we showed that ITIS performed better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than other similar algorithms such as RelocaTE, RetroSeq, TEMP and TIF. With the case study data, we demonstrated the efficiency of ITIS by validating the presence and zygosity of predicted insertion sites of the Tnt1 transposon within a complex plant system, M. truncatula.
Conclusion: This study showed that ITIS is a robust and powerful tool for forward genetic studies in identifying transposable element insertions causing phenotypes. ITIS is suitable in various systems such as cell culture, bacteria, yeast, insect, mammal and plant.},

              BACKGROUND
              Genomes are subject to two types of changes: changes to the DNA sequence, and changes that are epigenetic in nature. Changes to the DNA sequence can result from errors made during DNA replication and/or repair, or from the insertion of mobile DNA. Mobile DNAs, also called transposable elements (TEs), have the potential to provide regulatory and/or protein-coding sequences at a new integration site. Depending on its nucleotide sequence and genomic insertion site, an individual TE can disrupt gene expression, directly or indirectly create an advantageous modification to gene expression, or be of no immediate consequence. Changes can be genetic, epigenetic, or both. In this way, TEs are molecular parasites and evolutionary drivers, each role originating from the ability to insert into, spread through, and restructure genomes. This review focuses on the types of TEs that transpose via RNA intermediates—retrotransposons—that are not bounded by long terminal repeats. The most abundant retrotransposons in animal genomes come in two forms: long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs).
            
            
              ADVANCES
              The advent of deep genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, together with studies of individual LINE or SINE functions, has led to a greater appreciation of how the two TEs influence gene expression. Our review focuses principally on data that derive from human and mouse studies. These data demonstrate that LINEs and SINEs perform many diverse roles within cells. As DNA sequences, they can regulate gene transcription by altering chromatin structure and by functioning as enhancers or promoters. When transcribed as part of a larger transcript, they can create new transcript isoforms (by influencing alternative pre-mRNA splicing or 3′-end formation), alter mRNA localization, change mRNA stability, tune the level of mRNA translation, or encode amino acids that diversify the proteome. Further, the RNA transcripts of LINEs or SINEs may themselves function to regulate gene expression. Through their various roles, TEs influence many aspects of cellular metabolism, including the ability to divide, migrate, differentiate, and respond to stress.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              TEs continue to spread throughout our genomes in both gametes and somatic tissues, introducing new gene regulatory activities or causing disease. Although deep transcriptome sequencing has identified a myriad of SINE-containing noncoding RNAs, the functional importance of most of these transcripts remains unknown. Additionally, we need to understand the consequence of the very high degree of TE transposition in our brains. We also need to uncover the determinants that influence the effect of a specific SINE on gene expression, and, given that different organisms can contain SINEs of distinct origins, the extent to which these SINEs contribute to species-specific differences. Moreover, it will be important to determine the extent to which independently evolved SINEs have been co-opted for similar functions.
              
                
                  Some of the steps in the expression of mammalian genes that can be affected by cis- or trans-acting LINEs or SINEs.
                  LINE and SINE genomic insertions can regulate gene expression by altering transcription and/or chromatin structure. When embedded in the transcripts of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)–transcribed genes, SINEs can influence nuclear pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear mRNA retention in paraspeckles, cytoplasmic mRNA stability, or cytoplasmic mRNA translation.​ ARE-BP, AU-rich element–binding protein.

            Transposable elements (TEs) are both a boon and a bane to eukaryotic organisms, depending on where they integrate into the genome and how their sequences function once integrated. We focus on two types of TEs: long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs). LINEs and SINEs are retrotransposons; that is, they transpose via an RNA intermediate. We discuss how LINEs and SINEs have expanded in eukaryotic genomes and contribute to genome evolution. An emerging body of evidence indicates that LINEs and SINEs function to regulate gene expression by affecting chromatin structure, gene transcription, pre-mRNA processing, or aspects of mRNA metabolism. We also describe how adenosine-to-inosine editing influences SINE function and how ongoing retrotransposition is countered by the body’s defense mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Background: Maize was originally domesticated in a tropical environment but is now widely cultivated at temperate latitudes. Temperate and tropical maize populations have diverged both genotypically and phenotypically. Tropical maize lines grown in temperate environments usually exhibit delayed flowering, pollination, and seed set, which reduces their grain yield relative to temperate adapted maize lines. One potential mechanism by which temperate maize may have adapted to a new environment is novel transposable element insertions, which can influence gene regulation. Recent advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to study variation in transposon content and insertion location in large sets of maize lines.
Results: In total, 274,408 non-redundant TEs (NRTEs) were identified using resequencing data generated from 83 maize inbred lines. The locations of DNA TEs and copia-superfamily retrotransposons showed significant positive correlations with gene density and genetic recombination rates, whereas gypsy-superfamily retrotransposons showed a negative correlation with these two parameters. Compared to tropical maize, temperate maize had fewer unique NRTEs but higher insertion frequency, lower background recombination rates, and higher linkage disequilibrium, with more NRTEs close to flowering and stress-related genes in the genome. Association mapping demonstrated that the presence/ absence of 48 NRTEs was associated with flowering time and that expression of neighboring genes differed between haplotypes where a NRTE was present or absent.
Conclusions: This study suggests that NRTEs may have played an important role in creating the variation in gene regulation that enabled the rapid adaptation of maize to diverse environments.},

	abstract = {Background: While most cells in multicellular organisms carry the same genetic information, in each cell type only a subset of genes is being transcribed. Such differentiation in gene expression depends, for a large part, on the activation and repression of regulatory sequences, including transcriptional enhancers. Transcriptional enhancers can be located tens of kilobases from their target genes, but display characteristic chromatin and DNA features, allowing their identification by genome-wide profiling. Here we show that integration of chromatin characteristics can be applied to predict distal enhancer candidates in Zea mays, thereby providing a basis for a better understanding of gene regulation in this important crop plant.
Result: To predict transcriptional enhancers in the crop plant maize (Zea mays L. ssp. mays), we integrated available genome-wide DNA methylation data with newly generated maps for chromatin accessibility and histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) enrichment in young seedling and husk tissue. Approximately 1500 intergenic regions, displaying low DNA methylation, high chromatin accessibility and H3K9ac enrichment, were classified as enhancer candidates. Based on their chromatin profiles, candidate sequences can be classified into four subcategories. Tissue-specificity of enhancer candidates is defined based on the tissues in which they are identified and putative target genes are assigned based on tissue-specific expression patterns of flanking genes.
Conclusions: Our method identifies three previously identified distal enhancers in maize, validating the new set of enhancer candidates and enlarging the toolbox for the functional characterization of gene regulation in the highly repetitive maize genome.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The precise location of variants in the human genome is of utmost importance. We present a unique approach, coverage-based single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification (COBASI), which uses only perfect matches between the reads of a sequence project and a reference genome to detect and accurately identify de novo SNVs. From the perfect matches, a representation of the read coverage per nucleotide along the genome, the variation landscape, is generated. SNVs are then pinpointed as significant changes in coverage and de novo SNVs can be identified with high precision. The performance of COBASI was analyzed using simulations and experimentally validated by sequencing de novo SNVs identified from a parent–offspring trio. We propose this pipeline as a useful tool for different genomic applications.
          , 
            
              The precise determination of de novo genetic variants has enormous implications across different fields of biology and medicine, particularly personalized medicine. Currently, de novo variations are identified by mapping sample reads from a parent–offspring trio to a reference genome, allowing for a certain degree of differences. While widely used, this approach often introduces false-positive (FP) results due to misaligned reads and mischaracterized sequencing errors. In a previous study, we developed an alternative approach to accurately identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using only perfect matches. However, this approach could be applied only to haploid regions of the genome and was computationally intensive. In this study, we present a unique approach, coverage-based single nucleotide variant identification (COBASI), which allows the exploration of the entire genome using second-generation short sequence reads without extensive computing requirements. COBASI identifies SNVs using changes in coverage of exactly matching unique substrings, and is particularly suited for pinpointing de novo SNVs. Unlike other approaches that require population frequencies across hundreds of samples to filter out any methodological biases, COBASI can be applied to detect de novo SNVs within isolated families. We demonstrate this capability through extensive simulation studies and by studying a parent–offspring trio we sequenced using short reads. Experimental validation of all 58 candidate de novo SNVs and a selection of non-de novo SNVs found in the trio confirmed zero FP calls. COBASI is available as open source at

              -mer analysis) is a software that enables comprehensive analysis of sequencing data from large cohorts to generate robust classification models or explore specific genetic elements associated with disease etiology. iMOKA uses a fast and accurate feature reduction step that combines a Naïve Bayes classifier augmented by an adaptive entropy filter and a graph-based filter to rapidly reduce the search space. By using a flexible file format and distributed indexing, iMOKA can easily integrate data from multiple experiments and also reduces disk space requirements and identifies changes in transcript levels and single nucleotide variants. iMOKA is available at

	abstract = {Significance
            One fundamental analysis needed to interpret genome assemblies is genome alignment. Yet, accurately aligning regulatory and transposon regions outside of genes remains challenging. We introduce Anchored Wavefront alignment (AnchorWave), which implements a genome duplication informed longest path algorithm to identify collinear regions and performs base pair–resolved, end-to-end alignment for collinear blocks using an efficient two-piece affine gap cost strategy. AnchorWave improves the alignment under a number of scenarios: genomes with high similarity, large genomes with high transposable element activity, genomes with many inversions, and alignments between species with deeper evolutionary divergence and different whole-genome duplication histories. Potential use cases include genome comparison for evolutionary analysis of nongenic sequences and population genetics of taxa with large, repeat-rich genomes.
          , 
            Millions of species are currently being sequenced, and their genomes are being compared. Many of them have more complex genomes than model systems and raise novel challenges for genome alignment. Widely used local alignment strategies often produce limited or incongruous results when applied to genomes with dispersed repeats, long indels, and highly diverse sequences. Moreover, alignment using many-to-many or reciprocal best hit approaches conflicts with well-studied patterns between species with different rounds of whole-genome duplication. Here, we introduce Anchored Wavefront alignment (AnchorWave), which performs whole-genome duplication–informed collinear anchor identification between genomes and performs base pair–resolved global alignment for collinear blocks using a two-piece affine gap cost strategy. This strategy enables AnchorWave to precisely identify multikilobase indels generated by transposable element (TE) presence/absence variants (PAVs). When aligning two maize genomes, AnchorWave successfully recalled 87\% of previously reported TE PAVs. By contrast, other genome alignment tools showed low power for TE PAV recall. AnchorWave precisely aligns up to three times more of the genome as position matches or indels than the closest competitive approach when comparing diverse genomes. Moreover, AnchorWave recalls transcription factor–binding sites at a rate of 1.05- to 74.85-fold higher than other tools with significantly lower false-positive alignments. AnchorWave complements available genome alignment tools by showing obvious improvement when applied to genomes with dispersed repeats, active TEs, high sequence diversity, and whole-genome duplication variation.},

	abstract = {Background: Advances in sequencing technologies have led to the release of reference genomes and annotations for multiple individuals within more well-studied systems. While each of these new genome assemblies shares significant portions of synteny between each other, the annotated structure of gene models within these regions can differ. Of particular concern are split-gene misannotations, in which a single gene is incorrectly annotated as two distinct genes or two genes are incorrectly annotated as a single gene. These misannotations can have major impacts on functional prediction, estimates of expression, and many downstream analyses.
Results: We developed a high-throughput method based on pairwise comparisons of annotations that detect potential split-gene misannotations and quantifies support for whether the genes should be merged into a single gene model. We demonstrated the utility of our method using gene annotations of three reference genomes from maize (B73, PH207, and W22), a difficult system from an annotation perspective due to the size and complexity of the genome. On average, we found several hundred of these potential split-gene misannotations in each pairwise comparison, corresponding to 3–5\% of gene models across annotations. To determine which state (i.e. one gene or multiple genes) is biologically supported, we utilized RNAseq data from 10 tissues throughout development along with a novel metric and simulation framework. The methods we have developed require minimal human interaction and can be applied to future assemblies to aid in annotation efforts.
Conclusions: Split-gene misannotations occur at appreciable frequency in maize annotations. We have developed a method to easily identify and correct these misannotations. Importantly, this method is generic in that it can utilize any type of short-read expression data. Failure to account for split-gene misannotations has serious consequences for biological inference, particularly for expression-based analyses.},

            A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment (msa) of proteins. In the model, each column of symbols in the alignment is represented by a frequency distribution of the symbols (called a “state”), and insertions and deletions are represented by other states. One moves through the model along a particular path from state to state in a Markov chain (i.e., random choice of next move), trying to match a given sequence. The next matching symbol is chosen from each state, recording its probability (frequency) and also the probability of going to that state from a previous one (the transition probability). State and transition probabilities are multiplied to obtain a probability of the given sequence. The hidden nature of the HMM is due to the lack of information about the value of a specific state, which is instead represented by a probability distribution over all possible values. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of HMMs in msa and presents algorithms for calculating an HMM and the conditions for producing the best HMM.},

	abstract = {Background: The generation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a crucial step for many bioinformatic analyses. Thus improving MSA accuracy and identifying potential errors in MSAs is important for a wide range of post-genomic research. We present a novel method called MergeAlign which constructs consensus MSAs from multiple independent MSAs and assigns an alignment precision score to each column.
Results: Using conventional benchmark tests we demonstrate that on average MergeAlign MSAs are more accurate than MSAs generated using any single matrix of sequence substitution. We show that MergeAlign column scores are related to alignment precision and hence provide an ab initio method of estimating alignment precision in the absence of curated reference MSAs. Using two novel and independent alignment performance tests that utilise a large set of orthologous gene families we demonstrate that increasing MSA performance leads to an increase in the performance of downstream phylogenetic analyses.
Conclusion: Using multiple tests of alignment performance we demonstrate that this novel method has broad general application in biological research.},

	abstract = {De novo genome sequence assembly is important both to generate new sequence assemblies for previously uncharacterized genomes and to identify the genome sequence of individuals in a reference-unbiased way. We present memory efficient data structures and algorithms for assembly using the FM-index derived from the compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform, and a new assembler based on these called SGA (
              S
              tring
              G
              raph
              A
              ssembler). We describe algorithms to error-correct, assemble, and scaffold large sets of sequence data. SGA uses the overlap-based string graph model of assembly, unlike most de novo assemblers that rely on de Bruijn graphs, and is simply parallelizable. We demonstrate the error correction and assembly performance of SGA on 1.2 billion sequence reads from a human genome, which we are able to assemble using 54 GB of memory. The resulting contigs are highly accurate and contiguous, while covering 95\% of the reference genome (excluding contigs {\textless}200 bp in length). Because of the low memory requirements and parallelization without requiring inter-process communication, SGA provides the first practical assembler to our knowledge for a mammalian-sized genome on a low-end computing cluster.},

	abstract = {In a pair of seminal papers, Sewall Wright and Gustave Malécot introduced
              F
              ST
              as a measure of structure in natural populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate
              F
              ST
              from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of
              F
              ST
              for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed—in some cases more than twofold—when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in
              F
              ST
              from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of
              F
              ST
              that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating
              F
              ST
              for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of
              F
              ST
              across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in
              F
              ST
              estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions.},

	abstract = {Practical identifiability of Systems Biology models has received a lot of attention in recent scientific research. It addresses the crucial question for models’ predictability: how accurately can the models’ parameters be recovered from available experimental data. The methods based on profile likelihood are among the most reliable methods of practical identification. However, these methods are often computationally demanding or lead to inaccurate estimations of parameters’ confidence intervals. Development of methods, which can accurately produce parameters’ confidence intervals in reasonable computational time, is of utmost importance for Systems Biology and QSP modeling.
            We propose an algorithm Confidence Intervals by Constraint Optimization (CICO) based on profile likelihood, designed to speed-up confidence intervals estimation and reduce computational cost. The numerical implementation of the algorithm includes settings to control the accuracy of confidence intervals estimates. The algorithm was tested on a number of Systems Biology models, including Taxol treatment model and STAT5 Dimerization model, discussed in the current article.
            
              The CICO algorithm is implemented in a software package freely available in Julia (
              https://github.com/insysbio/LikelihoodProfiler.jl
              ) and Python (

Results:  The method optimizes the choice of nonlinear transformations of dosages to maximize the Ky Fan norm of the covariance matrix. The transformation incorporates the uncertainty in calling between heterozygotes and the common homozygotes for loci having a rare allele and is more linear when both variants are common.
Conclusions:  We apply MCPCA\_PopGen to samples from two indigenous Siberian populations and reveal hidden population structure accurately using only a single chromosome. The MCPCA\_PopGen package is available on https://github.com/yiwen stat/MCPCA\_PopGen.},

	abstract = {A sound analysis of DNA sequencing data is important to extract meaningful information and infer quantities of interest. Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model
            organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read
            sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil-
            ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia},

	abstract = {Background: Maize (Zea mays) is a globally produced crop with broad genetic and phenotypic variation. New tools that improve our understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits are needed to guide predictive crop breeding. We have produced the first balanced multi-parental population in maize, a tool that provides high diversity and dense recombination events to allow routine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in maize.
Results: We produced 1,636 MAGIC maize recombinant inbred lines derived from eight genetically diverse founder lines. The characterization of 529 MAGIC maize lines shows that the population is a balanced, evenly differentiated mosaic of the eight founders, with mapping power and resolution strengthened by high minor allele frequencies and a fast decay of linkage disequilibrium. We show how MAGIC maize may find strong candidate genes by incorporating genome sequencing and transcriptomics data. We discuss three QTL for grain yield and three for flowering time, reporting candidate genes. Power simulations show that subsets of MAGIC maize might achieve high-power and high-definition QTL mapping.
Conclusions: We demonstrate MAGIC maize’s value in identifying the genetic bases of complex traits of agronomic relevance. The design of MAGIC maize allows the accumulation of sequencing and transcriptomics layers to guide the identification of candidate genes for a number of maize traits at different developmental stages. The characterization of the full MAGIC maize population will lead to higher power and definition in QTL mapping, and lay the basis for improved understanding of maize phenotypes, heterosis included.

	abstract = {Significance
            The maize genome, similar to those of most plant genomes, is 98\% noncoding. Much of the remainder is a vast desert of repeats that remain repressed throughout the cell cycle. The plant cell orchestrates its complex activities by restricting access to functional regions with an open chromatin configuration. Here, we identify the small portion ({\textless}1\%) of the maize genome residing in open chromatin. We demonstrate that open chromatin predicts molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and recombination. Furthermore, we show that genetic variation within open chromatin regions accounts for ∼40\% of phenotypic variation in agronomic traits. By greatly narrowing the scope of the functional maize genome, this study can help to accelerate the pace of crop improvement through highly focused genomic selection and genome editing.
          , 
            Cellular processes mediated through nuclear DNA must contend with chromatin. Chromatin structural assays can efficiently integrate information across diverse regulatory elements, revealing the functional noncoding genome. In this study, we use a differential nuclease sensitivity assay based on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion to discover open chromatin regions in the maize genome. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks. Although MNase HS regions map to less than 1\% of the genome, they consistently explain a remarkably large amount (∼40\%) of heritable phenotypic variance in diverse complex traits. MNase HS regions are therefore on par with coding sequences as annotations that demarcate the functional parts of the maize genome. These results imply that less than 3\% of the maize genome (coding and MNase HS regions) may give rise to the overwhelming majority of phenotypic variation, greatly narrowing the scope of the functional genome.},

	abstract = {Background: DNA methylation can provide a source of heritable information that is sometimes entirely uncoupled from genetic variation. However, the extent of this uncoupling and the roles of DNA methylation in shaping diversity of both gene expression and phenotypes are hotly debated. Here, we investigate the genetic basis and biological functions of DNA methylation at a population scale in maize.
Results: We perform targeted DNA methylation profiling for a diverse panel of 263 maize inbred genotypes. All genotypes show similar levels of DNA methylation globally, highlighting the importance of DNA methylation in maize development. Nevertheless, we identify more than 16,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are distributed across the 10 maize chromosomes. Genome-wide association analysis with high-density genetic markers reveals that over 60\% of the DMRs are not tagged by SNPs, suggesting the presence of unique information in DMRs. Strong associations between DMRs and the expression of many genes are identified in both the leaf and kernel tissues, pointing to the biological significance of methylation variation. Association analysis with 986 metabolic traits suggests that DNA methylation is associated with phenotypic variation of 156 traits. There are some traits that only show significant associations with DMRs and not with SNPs.
Conclusions: These results suggest that DNA methylation can provide unique information to explain phenotypic variation in maize.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Allelic chromosomal regions totaling more than 2.8 Mb and located on maize (Zea mays) chromosomes 1L, 2S, 7L, and 9S have been sequenced and compared over distances of 100 to 350 kb between the two maize inbred lines Mo17 and B73. The alleles contain extended regions of nonhomology. On average, more than 50\% of the compared sequence is noncolinear, mainly because of the insertion of large numbers of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons. Only 27 LTR-retroelements are shared between alleles, whereas 62 are allele specific. The insertion of LTR-retrotransposons into the maize genome is statistically more recent for nonshared than shared ones. Most surprisingly, more than one-third of the genes (27/72) are absent in one of the inbreds at the loci examined. Such nonshared genes usually appear to be truncated and form clusters in which they are oriented in the same direction. However, the nonshared genome segments are gene-poor, relative to regions shared by both inbreds, with up to 12-fold difference in gene density. By contrast, miniature inverted terminal repeats (MITEs) occur at a similar frequency in the shared and nonshared fractions. Many times, MITES are present in an identical position in both LTRs of a retroelement, indicating that their insertion occurred before the replication of the retroelement in question. Maize ESTs and/or maize massively parallel signature sequencing tags were identified for the majority of the nonshared genes or homologs of them. In contrast with shared genes, which are usually conserved in gene order and location relative to rice (Oryza sativa), nonshared genes violate the maize colinearity with rice. Based on this, insertion by a yet unknown mechanism, rather than deletion events, seems to be the origin of the nonshared genes. The intergenic space between conserved genes is enlarged up to sixfold in maize compared with rice. Frequently, retroelement insertions create a different sequence environment adjacent to conserved genes.},

	abstract = {Background: Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), which seek the association between epigenetic marks and an outcome or exposure, involve multiple hypothesis testing. False discovery rate (FDR) control has been widely used for multiple testing correction. However, traditional FDR control methods do not use auxiliary covariates, and they could be less powerful if the covariates could inform the likelihood of the null hypothesis. Recently, many covariate-adaptive FDR control methods have been developed, but application of these methods to EWAS data has not yet been explored. It is not clear whether these methods can significantly improve detection power, and if so, which covariates are more relevant for EWAS data.
Results: In this study, we evaluate the performance of five covariate-adaptive FDR control methods with EWASrelated covariates using simulated as well as real EWAS datasets. We develop an omnibus test to assess the informativeness of the covariates. We find that statistical covariates are generally more informative than biological covariates, and the covariates of methylation mean and variance are almost universally informative. In contrast, the informativeness of biological covariates depends on specific datasets. We show that the independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) and covariate adaptive multiple testing (CAMT) method are overall more powerful, especially for sparse signals, and could improve the detection power by a median of 25\% and 68\% on real datasets, compared to the ST procedure. We further validate the findings in various biological contexts.
Conclusions: Covariate-adaptive FDR control methods with informative covariates can significantly increase the detection power for EWAS. For sparse signals, IHW and CAMT are recommended.},

              INTRODUCTION
              
                Fusarium
                head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that devastates global wheat production, with losses of billions of dollars annually. Unlike foliar diseases, FHB occurs directly on wheat spikes (inflorescences). The infection lowers grain yield and also causes the grain to be contaminated by mycotoxins produced by the
                Fusarium
                pathogen, thus imposing health threats to humans and livestock. Although plant breeders have improved wheat resistance to FHB, the lack of wheat strains with stable FHB resistance has limited progress.
              
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                Many genetic loci in wheat affect FHB resistance but most only have minor effects; only a few exhibit a stable major effect on resistance. Wheat relatives in the Triticeae tribe carry resistant genes to different diseases including FHB and thus can be alternative sources of FHB resistance for wheat breeding.
                Thinopyrum
                wheatgrass has been used as a source of beneficial genes transferable to wheat by distant hybridization breeding since the 1930s.
                Fhb7,
                a gene transferred from
                Thinopyrum
                to wheat, showed a stable large effect on FHB resistance. However, the lack of a
                Thinopyrum
                reference genome hampered gene cloning and marker development, delaying the use of
                Fhb7
                in wheat breeding. Here, we cloned
                Fhb7
                using a reference assembly that we generated for
                Th. elongatum
                and characterized its resistance mechanisms and evolutionary history.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                Using sequence data from
                Th. elongatum
                , we assembled the Triticeae E reference genome with 44,474 high-confidence genes annotated. Using this reference, we genetically mapped
                Fhb7
                and located it to a 245-kb genomic region. We determined a gene encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) as
                Fhb7
                by virus-induced gene silencing and evaluated mutants and transgenic plants. We discovered that Fhb7 detoxifies pathogen-produced trichothecene toxins by conjugating a glutathione (GSH) unit onto the epoxide moieties of type A and B trichothecenes.
                Fhb7
                GST homologs are absent in the plant kingdom, but one sequence showing {\textasciitilde}97\% identity with
                Fhb7
                was found in endophytic fungi of an
                Epichloë
                species that establishes symbiosis with temperate grasses. This result suggests that
                Fhb7
                might have been transferred from
                Epichloë
                to
                Th. elongatum
                through horizontal gene transfer. Finally, we demonstrated that
                Fhb7
                , when introgressed into diverse wheat backgrounds by distant hybridization, confers broad resistance to both FHB and crown rot without penalizing wheat yield. Our results suggest a source of
                Fusarium
                resistance for wheat improvement.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                Th. elongatum
                carries biotic and abiotic resistance genes and is a useful resource for wheat breeding. The assembled
                Th. elongatum
                reference genome can aid identification and cloning of such genes for wheat improvement. Cloning of
                Fhb7
                revealed that it encodes a GST that can detoxify trichothecene toxins. Thus,
                Fhb7
                resistance differs from
                Fhb1
                resistance, which depends on a reduction of pathogen growth in spikes, although both confer durable resistance. The ability of
                Fhb7
                to detoxify multiple mycotoxins produced by various
                Fusarium
                species demonstrates its potential as a source of resistance to the various diseases for which
                Fusarium
                trichothecenes are virulence factors. The deployment of
                Fhb7
                in commercial wheat cultivars could alleviate both the food safety issue for consumers and the yield loss problem for growers. Sequence homologies between fungal and plant
                Fhb7
                suggested that horizontal gene transfer may help to shape plant genomes.

              head blight (FHB), a fungal disease caused by
              Fusarium
              species that produce food toxins, currently devastates wheat production worldwide, yet few resistance resources have been discovered in wheat germplasm. Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene
              Fhb7
              by assembling the genome of
              Thinopyrum elongatum
              , a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding.
              Fhb7

              Fhb7
              GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that
              Th. elongatum
              has gained
              Fhb7

	abstract = {Abstract
            Transposable elements (TEs) occupy nearly 40\% of mammalian genomes and, whilst most are fragmentary and no longer capable of transposition, they can nevertheless contribute to cell function. TEs within genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II can be copied as parts of primary transcripts; however, their full contribution to mature transcript sequences remains unresolved. Here, using long and short read (LR and SR) RNA sequencing data, we show that 26\% of coding and 65\% of noncoding transcripts in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contain TE-derived sequences. Different TE families are incorporated into RNAs in unique patterns, with consequences to transcript structure and function. The presence of TE sequences within a transcript is correlated with TE-type specific changes in its subcellular distribution, alterations in steady-state levels and half-life, and differential association with RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs). We identify hPSC-specific incorporation of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and LINE:L1 into protein-coding mRNAs, which generate TE sequence-derived peptides. Finally, single cell RNA-seq reveals that hPSCs express ERV-containing transcripts, whilst differentiating subpopulations lack ERVs and express SINE and LINE-containing transcripts. Overall, our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the incorporation of TE sequences into the RNAs of hPSCs is more widespread and has a greater impact than previously appreciated.},

              Many gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have published their summary statistics, which can be used to gain insight into complex human traits by downstream analyses, such as fine mapping and co-localization. However, technical differences between these datasets are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue (
              https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl
              ), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are freely available to enable the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues.},

            Establishing the timescale of early land plant evolution is essential to testing hypotheses on the coevolution of land plants and Earth’s System. Here, we establish a timescale for early land plant evolution that integrates over competing hypotheses on bryophyte−tracheophyte relationships. We estimate land plants to have emerged in a middle Cambrian–Early Ordovocian interval, and vascular plants to have emerged in the Late Ordovician−Silurian. This timescale implies an early establishment of terrestrial ecosystems by land plants that is in close accord with recent estimates for the origin of terrestrial animal lineages. Biogeochemical models that are constrained by the fossil record of early land plants, or attempt to explain their impact, must consider a much earlier, middle Cambrian–Early Ordovician, origin.

            Establishing the timescale of early land plant evolution is essential for testing hypotheses on the coevolution of land plants and Earth’s System. The sparseness of early land plant megafossils and stratigraphic controls on their distribution make the fossil record an unreliable guide, leaving only the molecular clock. However, the application of molecular clock methodology is challenged by the current impasse in attempts to resolve the evolutionary relationships among the living bryophytes and tracheophytes. Here, we establish a timescale for early land plant evolution that integrates over topological uncertainty by exploring the impact of competing hypotheses on bryophyte−tracheophyte relationships, among other variables, on divergence time estimation. We codify 37 fossil calibrations for Viridiplantae following best practice. We apply these calibrations in a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis of a phylogenomic dataset encompassing the diversity of Embryophyta and their relatives within Viridiplantae. Topology and dataset sizes have little impact on age estimates, with greater differences among alternative clock models and calibration strategies. For all analyses, a Cambrian origin of Embryophyta is recovered with highest probability. The estimated ages for crown tracheophytes range from Late Ordovician to late Silurian. This timescale implies an early establishment of terrestrial ecosystems by land plants that is in close accord with recent estimates for the origin of terrestrial animal lineages. Biogeochemical models that are constrained by the fossil record of early land plants, or attempt to explain their impact, must consider the implications of a much earlier, middle Cambrian–Early Ordovician, origin.},

	abstract = {Background: In maize hybrid breeding, complementary pools of parental lines with reshuffled genetic variants are established for superior hybrid performance. To comprehensively decipher the genetics of heterosis, we present a new design of multiple linked F1 populations with 42,840 F1 maize hybrids, generated by crossing a synthetic population of 1428 maternal lines with 30 elite testers from diverse genetic backgrounds and phenotyped for agronomic traits.
Results: We show that, although yield heterosis is correlated with the widespread, minor-effect epistatic QTLs, it may be resulted from a few major-effect additive and dominant QTLs in early developmental stages. Floral transition is probably one critical stage for heterosis formation, in which epistatic QTLs are activated by paternal contributions of alleles that counteract the recessive, deleterious maternal alleles. These deleterious alleles, while rare, epistatically repress other favorable QTLs. We demonstrate this with one example, showing that Brachytic2 represses the Ubiquitin3 locus in the maternal lines; in hybrids, the paternal allele alleviates this repression, which in turn recovers the height of the plant and enhances the weight of the ear. Finally, we propose a molecular design breeding by manipulating key genes underlying the transition from vegetative-to-reproductive growth.
Conclusion: The new population design is used to dissect the genetic basis of heterosis which accelerates maize molecular design breeding by diminishing deleterious epistatic interactions.},

            An atlas of the maize functional genome reveals patterns of developmental regulation within tissues for the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome.
          , 
            Coexpression networks and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are emerging as important tools for predicting functional roles of individual genes at a system-wide scale. To enable network reconstructions, we built a large-scale gene expression atlas composed of 62,547 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 17,862 nonmodified proteins, and 6227 phosphoproteins harboring 31,595 phosphorylation sites quantified across maize development. Networks in which nodes are genes connected on the basis of highly correlated expression patterns of mRNAs were very different from networks that were based on coexpression of proteins. Roughly 85\% of highly interconnected hubs were not conserved in expression between RNA and protein networks. However, networks from either data type were enriched in similar ontological categories and were effective in predicting known regulatory relationships. Integration of mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein data sets greatly improved the predictive power of GRNs.},

            Intermediate outcrossing rates are theoretically predicted to maintain effective selection against harmful alleles, but few studies have empirically tested this prediction with the use of genomic data. We used whole-genome resequencing data from alpine rock-cress to study how genetic variation and purifying selection vary with mating system. We find that populations with intermediate outcrossing rates have similar levels of genetic diversity as outcrossing populations, and that purifying selection against harmful alleles is efficient in mixed-mating populations. In contrast, self-fertilizing populations from Scandinavia have strongly reduced genetic diversity and accumulate harmful mutations, likely as a result of demographic effects of postglacial colonization. Our results suggest that mixed-mating populations can avoid some of the negative evolutionary consequences of high self-fertilization rates.
          , 
            
              Plant mating systems have profound effects on levels and structuring of genetic variation and can affect the impact of natural selection. Although theory predicts that intermediate outcrossing rates may allow plants to prevent accumulation of deleterious alleles, few studies have empirically tested this prediction using genomic data. Here, we study the effect of mating system on purifying selection by conducting population-genomic analyses on whole-genome resequencing data from 38 European individuals of the arctic-alpine crucifer
              Arabis alpina
              . We find that outcrossing and mixed-mating populations maintain genetic diversity at similar levels, whereas highly self-fertilizing Scandinavian
              A. alpina
              show a strong reduction in genetic diversity, most likely as a result of a postglacial colonization bottleneck. We further find evidence for accumulation of genetic load in highly self-fertilizing populations, whereas the genome-wide impact of purifying selection does not differ greatly between mixed-mating and outcrossing populations. Our results demonstrate that intermediate levels of outcrossing may allow efficient selection against harmful alleles, whereas demographic effects can be important for relaxed purifying selection in highly selfing populations. Thus, mating system and demography shape the impact of purifying selection on genomic variation in
              A. alpina
              . These results are important for an improved understanding of the evolutionary consequences of mating system variation and the maintenance of mixed-mating strategies.},

            Evolution is change in the genetic composition of populations. In nature, individuals reproduce, die, and move among populations, leading to changes in the population frequency of the alleles they carry. Here we study an extensive family tree (pedigree) for an exhaustively sampled natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays to directly characterize the mechanisms underlying how genetic material is transmitted to future generations. We link individual fitness with long-term genetic contributions and quantify the relative roles of evolutionary processes governing allele frequency change. This study clearly illustrates how short-term evolutionary change occurs within a natural population.
          , 
            
              A central goal of population genetics is to understand how genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow shape allele frequencies through time. However, the actual processes underlying these changes—variation in individual survival, reproductive success, and movement—are often difficult to quantify. Fully understanding these processes requires the population pedigree, the set of relationships among all individuals in the population through time. Here, we use extensive pedigree and genomic information from a long-studied natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays (
              Aphelocoma coerulescens
              ) to directly characterize the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping patterns of genetic variation through time. We performed gene dropping simulations to estimate individual genetic contributions to the population and model drift on the known pedigree. We found that observed allele frequency changes are generally well predicted by accounting for the different genetic contributions of founders. Our results show that the genetic contribution of recent immigrants is substantial, with some large allele frequency shifts that otherwise may have been attributed to selection actually due to gene flow. We identified a few SNPs under directional short-term selection after appropriately accounting for gene flow. Using models that account for changes in population size, we partitioned the proportion of variance in allele frequency change through time. Observed allele frequency changes are primarily due to variation in survival and reproductive success, with gene flow making a smaller contribution. This study provides one of the most complete descriptions of short-term evolutionary change in allele frequencies in a natural population to date.},

              Maize originated in what is now central Mexico about 9000 years ago and spread throughout the Americas before European contact. Kistler
              et al.
              applied genomic analysis to ancient and extant South American maize lineages to investigate the genetic changes that accompanied domestication (see the Perspective by Zeder). The origin of modern maize cultivars likely involved a “semidomesticated” lineage that moved out of Mexico. Later improvements then occurred among multiple South American populations, including those in southwestern Amazonia.

            A complex history of maize domestication arose from a secondary improvement center in the southwest Amazon.
          , 
            Domesticated maize evolved from wild teosinte under human influences in Mexico beginning around 9000 years before the present (yr B.P.), traversed Central America by {\textasciitilde}7500 yr B.P., and spread into South America by {\textasciitilde}6500 yr B.P. Landrace and archaeological maize genomes from South America suggest that the ancestral population to South American maize was brought out of the domestication center in Mexico and became isolated from the wild teosinte gene pool before traits of domesticated maize were fixed. Deeply structured lineages then evolved within South America out of this partially domesticated progenitor population. Genomic, linguistic, archaeological, and paleoecological data suggest that the southwestern Amazon was a secondary improvement center for partially domesticated maize. Multiple waves of human-mediated dispersal are responsible for the diversity and biogeography of modern South American maize.},

	abstract = {Background: The human genome contains “dark” gene regions that cannot be adequately assembled or aligned using standard short-read sequencing technologies, preventing researchers from identifying mutations within these gene regions that may be relevant to human disease. Here, we identify regions with few mappable reads that we call dark by depth, and others that have ambiguous alignment, called camouflaged. We assess how well long-read or linked-read technologies resolve these regions.
Results: Based on standard whole-genome Illumina sequencing data, we identify 36,794 dark regions in 6054 gene bodies from pathways important to human health, development, and reproduction. Of these gene bodies, 8.7\% are completely dark and 35.2\% are ≥ 5\% dark. We identify dark regions that are present in protein-coding exons across 748 genes. Linked-read or long-read sequencing technologies from 10x Genomics, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reduce dark protein-coding regions to approximately 50.5\%, 35.6\%, and 9.6\%, respectively. We present an algorithm to resolve most camouflaged regions and apply it to the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project. We rescue a rare ten-nucleotide frameshift deletion in CR1, a top Alzheimer’s disease gene, found in disease cases but not in controls.
Conclusions: While we could not formally assess the association of the CR1 frameshift mutation with Alzheimer’s disease due to insufficient sample-size, we believe it merits investigating in a larger cohort. There remain thousands of potentially important genomic regions overlooked by short-read sequencing that are largely resolved by longread technologies.},

              The mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation to changing environments in species with reduced genetic variation, referred to as the “genetic paradox of invasion,” are unknown. We report that transposable elements (TEs) are highly enriched in the gene promoter regions of
              Capsella rubella
              compared with its outcrossing sister species
              Capsella grandiflora
              . We also show that a number of polymorphic TEs in
              C. rubella
              are associated with changes in gene expression. Frequent TE insertions at
              FLOWERING LOCUS C
              of
              C. rubella
              affect flowering-time variation, an important life history trait correlated with fitness. These results indicate that TE insertions drive rapid phenotypic variation, which could potentially help adapting to novel environments in species with limited genetic variation.
            
          , 
            
              Rapid phenotypic changes in traits of adaptive significance are crucial for organisms to thrive in changing environments. How such phenotypic variation is achieved rapidly, despite limited genetic variation in species that experience a genetic bottleneck is unknown.
              Capsella rubella
              , an annual and inbreeding forb (Brassicaceae), is a great system for studying this basic question. Its distribution is wider than those of its congeneric species, despite an extreme genetic bottleneck event that severely diminished its genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate that transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genetic variation that could account for its high phenotypic diversity. TEs are (
              i
              ) highly enriched in
              C. rubella
              compared with its outcrossing sister species
              Capsella grandiflora
              , and (
              ii
              ) 4.2\% of polymorphic TEs in
              C. rubella
              are associated with variation in the expression levels of their adjacent genes. Furthermore, we show that frequent TE insertions at
              FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)
              in natural populations of
              C. rubella
              could explain 12.5\% of the natural variation in flowering time, a key life history trait correlated with fitness and adaptation. In particular, we show that a recent TE insertion at the 3′ UTR of
              FLC
              affects mRNA stability, which results in reducing its steady-state expression levels, to promote the onset of flowering. Our results highlight that TE insertions can drive rapid phenotypic variation, which could potentially help with adaptation to changing environments in a species with limited standing genetic variation.},

              compared gene regulatory networks activated by flooding in rice, which is adapted to flooding, with those in species less adapted to flooding. Flood-related gene regulation was characterized according to chromatin accessibility as well as transcription. Although flood response circuitry is evident in dryland species as well, its activation is greater in wetland rice.

            Conserved submergence-activated gene families display flexibility in regulatory circuitry.
          , 
            Flooding due to extreme weather threatens crops and ecosystems. To understand variation in gene regulatory networks activated by submergence, we conducted a high-resolution analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression at three scales of transcript control in four angiosperms, ranging from a dryland-adapted wild species to a wetland crop. The data define a cohort of conserved submergence-activated genes with signatures of overlapping cis regulation by four transcription factor families. Syntenic genes are more highly expressed than nonsyntenic genes, yet both can have the cis motifs and chromatin accessibility associated with submergence up-regulation. Whereas the flexible circuitry spans the eudicot-monocot divide, the frequency of specific cis motifs, extent of chromatin accessibility, and degree of submergence activation are more prevalent in the wetland crop and may have adaptive importance.},

              In the statistical analysis of genome-wide association data, it is challenging to precisely localize the variants that affect complex traits, due to linkage disequilibrium, and to maximize power while limiting spurious findings. Here we report on
              KnockoffZoom
              : a flexible method that localizes causal variants at multiple resolutions by testing the conditional associations of genetic segments of decreasing width, while provably controlling the false discovery rate. Our method utilizes artificial genotypes as negative controls and is equally valid for quantitative and binary phenotypes, without requiring any assumptions about their genetic architectures. Instead, we rely on well-established genetic models of linkage disequilibrium. We demonstrate that our method can detect more associations than mixed effects models and achieve fine-mapping precision, at comparable computational cost. Lastly, we apply
              KnockoffZoom
              to data from 350k subjects in the UK Biobank and report many new findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identiﬁed thousands of genetic variants that are associated with many complex traits. However, their biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Transcriptomewide association studies (TWAS) have been recently proposed as an invaluable tool for investigating the potential gene regulatory mechanisms underlying variant-trait associations. Speciﬁcally, TWAS integrate GWAS with expression mapping studies based on a common set of variants and aim to identify genes whose GReX is associated with the phenotype. Various methods have been developed for performing TWAS and/or similar integrative analysis. Each such method has a different modeling assumption and many were initially developed to answer different biological questions. Consequently, it is not straightforward to understand their modeling property from a theoretical perspective.
Results: We present a technical review on thirteen TWAS methods. Importantly, we show that these methods can all be viewed as two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, which has been widely applied in GWASs for examining the causal effects of exposure on outcome. Viewing different TWAS methods from an MR perspective provides us a unique angle for understanding their beneﬁts and pitfalls. We systematically introduce the MR analysis framework, explain how features of the GWAS and expression data inﬂuence the adaptation of MR for TWAS, and re-interpret the modeling assumptions made in different TWAS methods from an MR angle. We ﬁnally describe future directions for TWAS methodology development.
Conclusions: We hope that this review would serve as a useful reference for both methodologists who develop TWAS methods and practitioners who perform TWAS analysis.},

              Some organisms can switch metabolic pathways depending on their environment. One such example is yeast, which can transition between the sugars glucose and galactose as carbon sources. Boocock
              et al.
              show that this ability has undergone selection, resulting in the maintenance of two incompatible metabolic pathways in a select set of yeast strains within a single species. A phylogenetic analysis supports that these different pathways are mediated by three genes that differ between strains within and among yeast species and likely have been maintained over 10 million to 20 million years.

            Balancing selection maintains two functionally distinct, incompatible versions of the yeast galactose pathway.
          , 
            
              Metabolic pathways differ across species but are expected to be similar within a species. We discovered two functional, incompatible versions of the galactose pathway in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              . We identified a three-locus genetic interaction for growth in galactose, and used precisely engineered alleles to show that it arises from variation in the galactose utilization genes
              GAL2
              ,
              GAL1/10/7
              , and phosphoglucomutase (
              PGM1
              ), and that the reference allele of
              PGM1
              is incompatible with the alternative alleles of the other genes. Multiloci balancing selection has maintained the two incompatible versions of the pathway for millions of years. Strains with alternative alleles are found primarily in galactose-rich dairy environments, and they grow faster in galactose but slower in glucose, revealing a trade-off on which balancing selection may have acted.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly popular to identify associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic traits. The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses.
Methods: We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual‐level scores of genetic risk.
Results: The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands‐on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users.
Conclusions: By providing theoretical background and hands‐on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12920-018-0322-5},
	abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed relationships between over 57,000 genetic variants and diseases. However, unlike Mendelian diseases, complex diseases arise from the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Natural selection has led to a high tendency of risk alleles to be enriched in minor alleles in Mendelian diseases. Therefore, an allele that was previously advantageous or neutral may later become harmful, making it a risk allele.
Methods: Using data in the NHGRI-EBI Catalog and the VARIMED database, we investigated whether (1) GWASs more easily detect risk alleles and (2) facilitate evolutionary insights by comparing risk allele frequencies of different diseases. We conducted computer simulations of P-values for association tests when major and minor alleles were risk alleles. We compared the expected proportion of SNVs whose risk alleles were minor alleles with the observed proportion.
Results: Our statistical results revealed that risk alleles were enriched in minor alleles, especially for variants with low minor allele frequencies (MAFs {\textless} 0.1). Our computer simulations revealed that {\textgreater} 50\% risk alleles were minor alleles because of the larger difference in the power of GWASs to differentiate between minor and major alleles, especially with low MAFs or when the number of controls exceeds the number of cases. However, the observed ratios between minor and major alleles in low MAFs ({\textless} 0.1) were much larger than the expected ratios of GWAS’s power imbalance, especially for diseases whose average risk allele frequencies were low, such as myopia, sudden cardiac arrest, and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Conclusions: Minor alleles are more likely to be risk alleles in the published GWASs on complex diseases. One reason is that minor alleles are more easily detected as risk alleles in GWASs. Even when correcting for the GWAS’s power imbalance, minor alleles are more likely to be risk alleles, especially in some diseases whose average risk allele frequencies are low. These analyses serve as a starting point for future studies on quantifying the degree of negative natural selection in various complex diseases.},

	abstract = {Background Germline DNA copy number variation (CNV) is a ubiquitous source of genetic variation and remains largely unexplored in association with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk.
Methods CNV was quantified in the DNA of approximately 3500 cases and controls genotyped with the Illumina 610k and HumanOmni2.5M arrays. We performed a genome‐wide association study of common ({\textgreater}1\%) CNV regions (CNVRs) with EOC and high-grade serous (HGSOC) risk and, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), performed in silico analyses of tumor-gene expression.
Results Three CNVRs were associated (P{\textless}0.01) with EOC risk: two large ({\textasciitilde}100kb) regions within the 610k set and one small ({\textless}5kb) region with the higher resolution 2.5M data. Large CNVRs included a duplication at LILRA6 (OR=2.57, P=0.001) and a deletion at CYP2A7 (OR=1.90, P=0.007) that was strongly associated with HGSOC risk (OR=3.02, P=8.98x10-5). Somatic CYP2A7 alterations correlated with EGLN2 expression in tumors (P=2.94x10-47). An intronic ERBB4/HER4 deletion was associated with reduced EOC risk (OR=0.33, P=9.5x10-2) and somatic deletions correlated with ERBB4 downregulation (P=7.05x10-5). Five CNVRs were associated with HGSOC including two reduced-risk deletions: one at 1p36.33 (OR=0.28, P=0.001) that correlated with lower CDKIIA expression in TCGA tumors (P=2.7x10-7), and another at 8p21.2 (OR=0.52, P=0.002) that was present somatically where it correlated with lower GNRH1 expression (P=5.9x10-5).
Conclusions Though CNV appears to not contribute largely to EOC susceptibility, a number of low-tocommon frequency variants may influence the risk of EOC and tumor gene expression. Impact Further research on CNV and EOC susceptibility is warranted, particularly with CNVs estimated from high-density arrays.},

              Genetic variation drives the spectrum of human phenotypes but in some cases has been linked to pathological conditions. Strober
              et al.
              set out to explore how genetic diversity regulates gene expression in cell differentiation over time. They examined expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLS)—genetic variants correlated with gene expression—in induced pluripotent stem cell lines from 19 Yoruban individuals at 16 time points during differentiation into cardiomyocytes. They identified hundreds of developmental stage–specific eQTLs. Thus, the impact of genetic variations depends on the developmental context or tissue under observation.

            Genetic variation affects temporal dynamics of gene expression in human cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells.
          , 
            Genetic regulation of gene expression is dynamic, as transcription can change during cell differentiation and across cell types. We mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) throughout differentiation to elucidate the dynamics of genetic effects on cell type–specific gene expression. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data, capturing 16 time points during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, in 19 human cell lines. We identified hundreds of dynamic eQTLs that change over time, with enrichment in enhancers of relevant cell types. We also found nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, which affect only intermediate stages of differentiation and cannot be found by using data from mature tissues. These fleeting genetic associations with gene regulation may explain some of the components of complex traits and disease. We highlight one example of a nonlinear eQTL that is associated with body mass index.},

              ssp.
              mays

              (

              ssp.
              mexicana
              ). Introgression from ecologically diverse teosinte may have facilitated maize’s global range expansion, in particular to challenging high elevation regions ({\textgreater} 1500 m). We generated low-coverage genome sequencing data for 348 maize and
              mexicana
              individuals to evaluate patterns of introgression in 14 sympatric population pairs, spanning the elevational range of
              mexicana
              , a teosinte endemic to the mountains of Mexico. While recent hybrids are commonly observed in sympatric populations and
              mexicana
              demonstrates fine-scale local adaptation, we find that the majority of
              mexicana
              ancestry tracts introgressed into maize over 1000 generations ago. This
              mexicana
              ancestry seems to have maintained much of its diversity and likely came from a common ancestral source, rather than contemporary sympatric populations, resulting in relatively low

              Introgressed
              mexicana
              ancestry in maize is reduced in lower-recombination rate quintiles of the genome and around domestication genes, consistent with pervasive selection against introgression. However, we also find
              mexicana
              ancestry increases across the sampled elevational gradient and that high introgression peaks are most commonly shared among high-elevation maize populations, consistent with introgression from
              mexicana
              facilitating adaptation to the highland environment. In the other direction, we find patterns consistent with adaptive and clinal introgression of maize ancestry into sympatric
              mexicana
              at many loci across the genome, suggesting that maize also contributes to adaptation in
              mexicana
              , especially at the lower end of its elevational range. In sympatric maize, in addition to high introgression regions we find many genomic regions where selection for local adaptation maintains steep gradients in introgressed
              mexicana
              ancestry across elevation, including at least two inversions: the well-characterized 14 Mb
              Inv4m
              on chromosome 4 and a novel 3 Mb inversion
              Inv9f
              surrounding the
              macrohairless1
              locus on chromosome 9. Most outlier loci with high
              mexicana
              introgression show no signals of sweeps or local sourcing from sympatric populations and so likely represent ancestral introgression sorted by selection, resulting in correlated but distinct outcomes of introgression in different contemporary maize populations.},

	abstract = {Ancient human migrations led to the settlement of population groups in varied environmental contexts worldwide. The extent to which adaptation to local environments has shaped human genetic diversity is a longstanding question in human evolution. Recent studies have suggested that introgression of archaic alleles in the genome of modern humans may have contributed to adaptation to environmental pressures such as pathogen exposure. Functional genomic studies have demonstrated that variation in gene expression across individuals and in response to environmental perturbations is a main mechanism underlying complex trait variation. We considered gene expression response to
              in vitro
              treatments as a molecular phenotype to identify genes and regulatory variants that may have played an important role in adaptations to local environments. We investigated if Neanderthal introgression in the human genome may contribute to the transcriptional response to environmental perturbations. To this end we used eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in a panel of 52 cellular environments, resulting from 5 cell types and 26 treatments, including hormones, vitamins, drugs, and environmental contaminants. We found that SNPs with introgressed Neanderthal alleles (N-SNPs) disrupt binding of transcription factors important for environmental responses, including ionizing radiation and hypoxia, and for glucose metabolism. We identified an enrichment for N-SNPs among eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in response to 8 treatments, including glucocorticoids, caffeine, and vitamin D. Using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) data, we validated the regulatory function of 21 introgressed Neanderthal variants in the human genome, corresponding to 8 eQTLs regulating 15 genes that respond to environmental perturbations. These findings expand the set of environments where archaic introgression may have contributed to adaptations to local environments in modern humans and provide experimental validation for the regulatory function of introgressed variants.},

              have facilitated key discoveries in genetics, genomics, and evolution. While high-quality genome assemblies exist for several species in this group, they only encompass a small fraction of the genus. Recent advances in long-read sequencing allow high-quality genome assemblies for tens or even hundreds of species to be efficiently generated. Here, we utilize Oxford Nanopore sequencing to build an open community resource of genome assemblies for 101 lines of 93 drosophilid species encompassing 14 species groups and 35 sub-groups. The genomes are highly contiguous and complete, with an average contig N50 of 10.5 Mb and greater than 97\% BUSCO completeness in 97/101 assemblies. We show that Nanopore-based assemblies are highly accurate in coding regions, particularly with respect to coding insertions and deletions. These assemblies, along with a detailed laboratory protocol and assembly pipelines, are released as a public resource and will serve as a starting point for addressing broad questions of genetics, ecology, and evolution at the scale of hundreds of species.},

            The transcription regulatory network inside a eukaryotic cell is defined by the combinatorial actions of transcription factors (TFs). However, TF binding studies in plants are too few in number to produce a general picture of this complex network. In this study, we use large-scale ChIP-seq to reconstruct it in the maize leaf, and train machine-learning models to predict TF binding and co-localization. The resulting network covers 77\% of the expressed genes, and shows a scale-free topology and functional modularity like a real-world network. TF binding sequence preferences are conserved within family, while co-binding could be key for their binding specificity. Cross-species comparison shows that core network nodes at the top of the transmission of information being more conserved than those at the bottom. This study reveals the complex and redundant nature of the plant transcription regulatory network, and sheds light on its architecture, organizing principle and evolutionary trajectory.},

            Multiple whole-genome alignment is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Despite many successes, current methods are not able to keep up with the growing number, length, and complexity of assembled genomes, especially when computational resources are limited. Approaches based on compacted de Bruijn graphs to identify and extend anchors into locally collinear blocks have potential for scalability, but current methods do not scale to mammalian genomes. We present an algorithm, SibeliaZ-LCB, for identifying collinear blocks in closely related genomes based on analysis of the de Bruijn graph. We further incorporate this into a multiple whole-genome alignment pipeline called SibeliaZ. SibeliaZ shows run-time improvements over other methods while maintaining accuracy. On sixteen recently-assembled strains of mice, SibeliaZ runs in under 16 hours on a single machine, while other tools did not run to completion for eight mice within a week. SibeliaZ makes a significant step towards improving scalability of multiple whole-genome alignment and collinear block reconstruction algorithms on a single machine.},

	abstract = {Background: Synonymous mutations do not change amino acids but do sometimes change the tRNAs (anticodons) that decode a particular codon. An isoaccepting codon is a synonymous codon that shares the same tRNA. If a mutated codon could base pair with the same anticodon as the original, the mutation is termed an isoaccepting mutation. An interesting but less-studied type of codon bias is codon co-occurrence bias. There is a trend to cluster the isoaccepting codons in the genome. The proposed advantage of codon co-occurrence bias is that the tRNA released from the ribosome E site could be quickly recharged and subsequently decode the following isoaccepting codons. This advantage would enhance translation efficiency. In plant species, whether there are signals of positive selection on isoaccepting mutations in the codon co-occurred regions has not been studied.
Results: We termed polymorphic mutations in coding regions using publicly available RNA-seq data in maize (Zea mays). Next, we classified all synonymous mutations into three categories according to the context, i.e., the relationship between the focal codon and the previous codon, as follows: isoaccepting, nonisoaccepting and nonsynonymous. We observed higher fractions of isoaccepting mutations in the isoaccepting context. If we looked at the minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum, the isoaccepting mutations have a higher MAF in the isoaccepting context than that in other regions, and accordingly, the nonisoaccepting mutations have a higher MAF in the nonisoaccepting context.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that in regions with codon co-occurrence bias, natural selection maintains this pattern by suppressing the nonisoaccepting mutations. However, if the consecutive codons are nonisoaccepting, mutations tend to switch these codons to become isoaccepting. Our study demonstrates that the codon co-occurrence bias in the maize genome is selectively maintained by natural selection and that the advantage of this trend could potentially be the rapid recharging and reuse of tRNAs to increase translation efficiency.},

              Synonymous mutations in genes do not change protein sequence, but they may affect gene expression and cellular function. Here we describe an unexpected toxic effect of synonymous mutations in
              Escherichia coli
              , with potentially large implications for bacterial physiology and evolution. Unlike previously studied effects of synonymous mutations, the effect that we discovered is independent of translation, but it depends on the production of toxic mRNA molecules. We hypothesize that the mechanism we identified influences the evolution of endogenous genes in bacteria by imposing selective constraints on synonymous mutations that arise in the genome. Of interest for biotechnology and synthetic biology, we identify bacterial strains and growth conditions that alleviate RNA toxicity, thus allowing efficient overexpression of heterologous proteins.
            
          , 
            
              Many organisms are subject to selective pressure that gives rise to unequal usage of synonymous codons, known as codon bias. To experimentally dissect the mechanisms of selection on synonymous sites, we expressed several hundred synonymous variants of the GFP gene in
              Escherichia coli
              , and used quantitative growth and viability assays to estimate bacterial fitness. Unexpectedly, we found many synonymous variants whose expression was toxic to
              E. coli
              . Unlike previously studied effects of synonymous mutations, the effect that we discovered is independent of translation, but it depends on the production of toxic mRNA molecules. We identified RNA sequence determinants of toxicity and evolved suppressor strains that can tolerate the expression of toxic GFP variants. Genome sequencing of these suppressor strains revealed a cluster of promoter mutations that prevented toxicity by reducing mRNA levels. We conclude that translation-independent RNA toxicity is a previously unrecognized obstacle in bacterial gene expression.},

              Cells accumulate mutations as we age, and these mutations can be a source of diseases such as cancer. How cells containing mutations evolve, are maintained, and proliferate within the body has not been well characterized. Using a quantitative framework, Watson
              et al.
              applied population genetic theory to estimate mutation accumulation in cells in blood from sequencing data derived from nearly 50,000 healthy individuals (see the Perspective by Curtis). By evaluating how mutations differ between blood cell populations, a phenomenon known as clonal hematopoiesis, the researchers could observe how recurrent mutations can drive certain clonal lineages to high frequencies within an individual. The risk of specific mutations, some of which are associated with leukemias, rising to high frequencies may therefore be a function of cellular selection and the age at which the mutation originated.

          , 
            Somatic mutations acquired in healthy tissues as we age are major determinants of cancer risk. Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance remains largely unknown. Blood sequencing data from {\textasciitilde}50,000 individuals reveal how mutation, genetic drift, and fitness shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood (clonal hematopoiesis). We show that positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal hematopoiesis, provide bounds on the number of hematopoietic stem cells, and quantify the fitness advantages of key pathogenic variants, at single-nucleotide resolution, as well as the distribution of fitness effects (fitness landscape) within commonly mutated driver genes. These data are consistent with clonal hematopoiesis being driven by a continuing risk of mutations and clonal expansions that become increasingly detectable with age.},

              The evolution of social behavior, and specifically of multicellularity, is poorly understood. An experimental model for multicellularity is the myxobacteria, which swarm and cooperate to form fruiting bodies in soil. Wielgoss
              et al.
              studied lineages of wild-caught myxobacteria. They found diversity, but also surprising genetic similarity, within fruiting bodies that was unlikely to be based on shared ancestry between them. Instead, reoccurrence of the same mutations seems to have occurred independently. These mutations have then been selected to confer similar phenotypes that converge on social behavior.

            Genomic convergence underlies social-phenotype evolution across fruiting bodies of cooperative bacteria isolated from soils.
          , 
            
              The composition of cooperative systems, including animal societies, organismal bodies, and microbial groups, reflects their past and shapes their future evolution. However, genomic diversity within many multiunit systems remains uncharacterized, limiting our ability to understand and compare their evolutionary character. We have analyzed genomic and social-phenotype variation among 120 natural isolates of the cooperative bacterium
              Myxococcus xanthus
              derived from six multicellular fruiting bodies. Each fruiting body was composed of multiple lineages radiating from a unique recent ancestor. Genomic evolution was concentrated in selection hotspots associated with evolutionary change in social phenotypes. Synonymous mutations indicated that kin lineages within the same fruiting body often first diverged from a common ancestor more than 100 generations ago. Thus, selection appears to promote endemic diversification of kin lineages that remain together over long histories of local interaction, thereby potentiating social coevolution.},

              GC skew denotes the relative excess of G nucleotides over C nucleotides on the leading versus the lagging replication strand of eubacteria. While the effect is small, typically around 2.5\%, it is robust and pervasive. GC skew and the analogous TA skew are a localized deviation from Chargaff’s second parity rule, which states that G and C, and T and A occur with (mostly) equal frequency even within a strand. Different bacterial phyla show different kinds of skew, and differing relations between TA and GC skew. This article introduces an open access database (
              https://skewdb.org
              ) of GC and 10 other skews for over 30,000 chromosomes and plasmids. Further details like codon bias, strand bias, strand lengths and taxonomic data are also included. The
              Skew
              DB can be used to generate or verify hypotheses. Since the origins of both the second parity rule and GC skew itself are not yet satisfactorily explained, such a database may enhance our understanding of prokaryotic DNA.},

              , is divided into four populations along the western North Atlantic, however, the only published mitochondrial genome sequence was assembled using one individual in Delaware. This study aimed to (1) assemble
              C. virginica
              mitochondrial genomes from Texas with pooled restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ezRAD), (2) evaluate the validity of the mitochondrial genome assemblies including comparison with Sanger sequencing data, and (3) evaluate genetic differentiation both between the Delaware and Texas genomes, as well as among three bays in Texas. The pooled-genome-assembled-genomes (PAGs) from Texas exhibited several characteristics indicating that they were valid, including elevated nucleotide diversity in non-coding and the third position of codons, placement as the sister haplotype of the genome from Delaware in a phylogenetic reconstruction of
              Crassostrea
              mitochondrial genomes, and a lack of genetic structure in the ND4 gene among the three Texas bays as was found with Sanger amplicons in samples from the same bays several years prior. In the comparison between the Delaware and Texas genome, 27 of 38 coding regions exhibited variability between the two populations, which were differentiated by 273 mutations, versus 1–13 mutations among the Texas samples. Using the full PAGs, there was no additional evidence for population structure among the three Texas bays. While population genetics is rapidly moving towards larger high-density datasets, studies of mitochondrial DNA (and genomes) can be particularly useful for comparing historic data prior to the modern era of genomics. As such, being able to reliably compile mitochondrial genomes from genomic data can improve the ability to compare results across studies.},

Here, we combined linkage mapping with genome scans to identify

            LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are ubiquitous and represent the dominant repeat element in plant genomes, playing important roles in functional variation, genome plasticity and evolution. With the advent of new sequencing technologies, a growing number of whole-genome sequences have been made publicly available, making it possible to carry out systematic analyses of LTR-RTs. However, a comprehensive and unified annotation of LTR-RTs in plant groups is still lacking. Here, we constructed a plant intact LTR-RTs dataset, which is designed to classify and annotate intact LTR-RTs with a standardized procedure. The dataset currently comprises a total of 2,593,685 intact LTR-RTs from genomes of 300 plant species representing 93 families of 46 orders. The dataset is accompanied by sequence, diverse structural and functional annotation, age determination and classification information associated with the LTR-RTs. This dataset will contribute valuable resources for investigating the evolutionary dynamics and functional implications of LTR-RTs in plant genomes.},

Despite their major role for plant genome evolution, no mobile LTR element with targeted integration into gene-poor regions has been identified in plants. Here, we report such targeted integrations de novo. We and others have previously shown that an

              family retrotransposon in
              Arabidopsis thaliana

              A. thaliana

              Arabidopsis lyrata

              A. lyrata
              elements directly, we introduced one of them, named
              Tal1

              elements in primates including lemur, marmoset, macaque, baboon, and chimpanzee as compared to human. We found that in lemurs,

              Alu

              Transposable elements (TEs) help shape the structure and function of the human genome. When inserted into some locations, TEs may disrupt gene regulation and cause diseases. Here, we present xTea (x-Transposable element analyzer), a tool for identifying TE insertions in whole-genome sequencing data. Whereas existing methods are mostly designed for short-read data, xTea can be applied to both short-read and long-read data. Our analysis shows that xTea outperforms other short read-based methods for both germline and somatic TE insertion discovery. With long-read data, we created a catalogue of polymorphic insertions with full assembly and annotation of insertional sequences for various types of retroelements, including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses. Notably, we find that individual genomes have an average of nine groups of full-length L1s in centromeres, suggesting that centromeres and other highly repetitive regions such as telomeres are a significant yet unexplored source of active L1s. xTea is available at

A proper evaluation of their evolutionary significance has been hampered by the paucity of short scale phylogenetic comparisons between closely related species. Here, we characterized the dynamics of TE accumulation at the micro-evolutionary scale by comparing two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis lyrata and A. halleri.
Results: Joint genome annotation in these two outcrossing species confirmed that both contain two distinct populations of TEs with either ‘recent’ or ‘old’ insertion histories. Identification of rare segregating insertions suggests that diverse TE families contribute to the ongoing dynamics of TE accumulation in the two species. Orthologous TE fragments (i.e. those that have been maintained in both species), tend to be located closer to genes than those that are retained in one species only. Compared to non-orthologous TE insertions, those that are orthologous tend to produce fewer short interfering RNAs, are less heavily methylated when found within or adjacent to genes and these tend to have lower expression levels. These findings suggest that long-term retention of TE insertions reflects their frequent acquisition of adaptive roles and/or the deleterious effects of removing nearly neutral TE insertions when they are close to genes.
Conclusion: Our results indicate a rapid evolutionary dynamics of the TE landscape in these two outcrossing species, with an important input of a diverse set of new insertions with variable propensity to resist deletion.},

              Bats are increasingly recognized as reservoir species for a variety of zoonotic viruses that pose severe threats to human health. While many RNA viruses have been identified in bats, little is known about bat retroviruses. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) represent genomic fossils of past retroviral infections and, thus, can inform us on the diversity and history of retroviruses that have infected a species lineage. Here, we took advantage of the availability of a high-quality genome assembly for the little brown bat,
              Myotis lucifugus
              , to systematically identify and analyze ERVs in this species. We mined an initial set of 362 potentially complete proviruses from the three main classes of ERVs, which were further resolved into 13 major families and 86 subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis. Consensus or representative sequences for each of the 86 subfamilies were then merged to the Repbase collection of known ERV/long terminal repeat (LTR) elements to annotate the retroviral complement of the bat genome. The results show that nearly 5\% of the genome assembly is occupied by ERV-derived sequences, a quantity comparable to findings for other eutherian mammals. About one-fourth of these sequences belong to subfamilies newly identified in this study. Using two independent methods, intraelement LTR divergence and analysis of orthologous loci in two other bat species, we found that the vast majority of the potentially complete proviruses identified in
              M. lucifugus
              were integrated in the last ∼25 million years. All three major ERV classes include recently integrated proviruses, suggesting that a wide diversity of retroviruses is still circulating in
              Myotis
              bats.},

	abstract = {Background: Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons (LTR retrotransposons) are mobile genetic elements composed of a few genes between terminal repeats and, in some cases, can comprise over half of a genome’s content. Available data on LTR retrotransposons have facilitated comparative studies and provided insight on genome evolution. However, data are biased to model systems and marine organisms, including annelids, have been underrepresented in transposable elements studies. Here, we focus on genome of Lamellibrachia luymesi, a vestimentiferan tubeworm from deep-sea hydrocarbon seeps, to gain knowledge of LTR retrotransposons in a deep-sea annelid.
Results: We characterized LTR retrotransposons present in the genome of L. luymesi using bioinformatic approaches and found that intact LTR retrotransposons makes up about 0.1\% of L. luymesi genome. Previous characterization of the genome has shown that this tubeworm hosts several known LTR-retrotransposons. Here we describe and classify LTR retrotransposons in L. luymesi as within the Gypsy, Copia and Bel-pao superfamilies. Although, many elements fell within already recognized families (e.g., Mag, CSRN1), others formed clades distinct from previously recognized families within these superfamilies. However, approximately 19\% (41) of recovered elements could not be classified. Gypsy elements were the most abundant while only 2 Copia and 2 Bel-pao elements were present. In addition, analysis of insertion times indicated that several LTR-retrotransposons were recently transposed into the genome of L. luymesi, these elements had identical LTR’s raising possibility of recent or ongoing retrotransposon activity.
Conclusions: Our analysis contributes to knowledge on diversity of LTR-retrotransposons in marine settings and also serves as an important step to assist our understanding of the potential role of retroelements in marine organisms. We find that many LTR retrotransposons, which have been inserted in the last few million years, are similar to those found in terrestrial model species. However, several new groups of LTR retrotransposons were discovered suggesting that the representation of LTR retrotransposons may be different in marine settings. Further study would improve understanding of the diversity of retrotransposons across animal groups and environments.},

              copia
              families from the large-genome plants barley and wheat to identify 46 families of homologous
              copia
              elements from rice and 22 from
              Arabidopsis
              , two plant species with much smaller genomes. In total, 599
              copia
              elements were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
              copia
              elements from the four species can be classified into six ancient lineages that existed before the divergence of monocots and dicots. The six lineages show a surprising degree of conservation in sequence organization and other characteristics across species. Additionally, the phylogenetic data suggest at least one case of horizontal gene transfer between the
              Arabidopsis
              and rice lineages. Insertion time estimates for 522 high-copy elements showed that retrotransposons from rice were active at different times in waves of activity lasting 0.5–2 million years, depending on the family, whereas elements from wheat and barley had longer periods of activity. We estimated that half of the rice
              copia
              elements are truncated or otherwise rearranged after ∼790,000 yr, which is almost twice the half-life of

              copia
              elements appear to have a massively longer half-life, beyond our ability to estimate from the available data. These findings suggest that genome size can be explained by the specific rate of DNA removal from the genome and the length of active periods of retrotransposon families.},

              Arabidopsis thaliana
              (125 megabases) and
              Brassica oleracea

              with a partial draft of
              B. oleracea
              has permitted an estimation of the patterns of TE amplification, diversification, and loss that has occurred in related species since their divergence from a common ancestor. Although we find that nearly all TE lineages are shared, the number of elements in each lineage is almost always greater in
              B. oleracea
              . Class 1 (retro) elements are the most abundant TE class in both species with LTR and non-LTR elements comprising the largest fraction of each genome. However, several families of class 2 (DNA) elements have amplified to very high copy number in
              B. oleracea
              where they have contributed significantly to genome expansion. Taken together, the results of this analysis indicate that amplification of both class 1 and class 2 TEs is responsible, in part, for

	abstract = {Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic fossils of ancient retroviral integrations that remain in the genome of many organisms. Most loci are rendered non-functional by mutations, but several intact retroviral genes are known in mammalian genomes. Some have been adopted by the host species, while the beneficial roles of others remain unclear. Besides the obvious possible immunogenic impact from transcribing intact viral genes, endogenous retroviruses have also become an interesting and useful tool to study phylogenetic relationships. The determination of the integration time of these viruses has been based upon the assumption that both 59 and 39 Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) sequences are identical at the time of integration, but evolve separately afterwards. Similar approaches have been using either a constant evolutionary rate or a range of rates for these viral loci, and only single species data. Here we show the advantages of using different approaches.
Results: We show that there are strong advantages in using multiple species data and state-of-the-art phylogenetic analysis. We incorporate both simple phylogenetic information and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to date the integrations of these viruses based on a relaxed molecular clock approach over a Bayesian phylogeny model and applied them to several selected ERV sequences in primates. These methods treat each ERV locus as having a distinct evolutionary rate for each LTR, and make use of consensual speciation time intervals between primates to calibrate the relaxed molecular clocks.
Conclusions: The use of a fixed rate produces results that vary considerably with ERV family and the actual evolutionary rate of the sequence, and should be avoided whenever multi-species phylogenetic data are available. For genome-wide studies, the simple phylogenetic approach constitutes a better alternative, while still being computationally feasible.},

	abstract = {Background: Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are major components of plant genomes. Common LTR-RTs contain the palindromic dinucleotide 5′-‘TG’–‘CA’-3′ motif at the ends. Thus, further analyses of noncanonical LTR-RTs with non-palindromic motifs will enhance our understanding of their structures and evolutionary history.
Results: Here, we report two new LTR-RT subfamilies (TGTT and AACA) with atypical dinucleotide ends of 5′-‘TG’–‘TT’-3′, and 5′-‘AA’–‘CA’-3′ in pear, apple, peach and mei. In total, 91 intact LTR-RTs were identified and classified into four TGTT and four AACA families. A structural annotation analysis showed that the four TGTT families, together with AACA1 and AACA2, belong to the Copia-like superfamily, whereas AACA3 and AACA4 appeared to be TRIM elements. The average amplification time frames for the eight families ranged from 0.05 to 2.32 million years. Phylogenetics coupled with sequence analyses revealed that the TGTT1 elements of peach were horizontally transferred from apple. In addition, 32 elements from two TGTT and three AACA families had detectable transcriptional activation, and a qRT-PCR analysis indicated that their expression levels varied dramatically in different species, organs and stress treatments.
Conclusions: Two novel LTR-RT subfamilies that terminated with non-palindromic dinucleotides at the ends of their LTRs were identified in four Rosaceae species, and a deep analysis showed their recent activity, horizontal transfer and varied transcriptional levels in different species, organs and stress treatments. This work enhances our understanding of the structural variation and evolutionary history of LTR-RTs in plants and also provides a valuable resource for future investigations of LTR-RTs having specific structures in other species.},

              Salamanders serve as important tetrapod models for developmental, regeneration and evolutionary studies. An extensive molecular toolkit makes the Mexican axolotl (
              Ambystoma mexicanum
              ) a key representative salamander for molecular investigations. Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the 32-gigabase-pair axolotl genome using an approach that combined long-read sequencing, optical mapping and development of a new genome assembler (MARVEL). We observed a size expansion of introns and intergenic regions, largely attributable to multiplication of long terminal repeat retroelements. We provide evidence that intron size in developmental genes is under constraint and that species-restricted genes may contribute to limb regeneration. The axolotl genome assembly does not contain the essential developmental gene
              Pax3
              . However, mutation of the axolotl
              Pax3
              paralogue
              Pax7
              resulted in an axolotl phenotype that was similar to those seen in

	abstract = {Background: The chloroplast genome is important for plant development and plant evolution. Nelumbo nucifera is one member of relict plants surviving from the late Cretaceous. Recently, a new sequencing platform PacBio RS II, known as ‘SMRT (Single Molecule, Real-Time) sequencing’, has been developed. Using the SMRT sequencing to investigate the chloroplast genome of N. nucifera will help to elucidate the plastid evolution of basal eudicots.
Results: The sizes of the de novo assembled complete chloroplast genome of N. nucifera were 163,307 bp, 163,747 bp and 163,600 bp with average depths of coverage of 7×, 712× and 105× sequenced by Sanger, Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II, respectively. The precise chloroplast genome of N. nucifera was obtained from PacBio RS II data proofread by Illumina MiSeq reads, with a quadripartite structure containing a large single copy region (91,846 bp) and a small single copy region (19,626 bp) separated by two inverted repeat regions (26,064 bp). The genome contains 113 different genes, including four distinct rRNAs, 30 distinct tRNAs and 79 distinct peptide-coding genes. A phylogenetic analysis of 133 taxa from 56 orders indicated that Nelumbo with an age of 177 million years is a sister clade to Platanus, which belongs to the basal eudicots. Basal eudicots began to emerge during the early Jurassic with estimated divergence times at 197 million years using MCMCTree. IR expansions/contractions within the basal eudicots seem to have occurred independently.
Conclusions: Because of long reads and lack of bias in coverage of AT-rich regions, PacBio RS II showed a great promise for highly accurate ‘finished’ genomes, especially for a de novo assembly of genomes. N. nucifera is one member of basal eudicots, however, evolutionary analyses of IR structural variations of N. nucifera and other basal eudicots suggested that IR expansions/contractions occurred independently in these basal eudicots or were caused by independent insertions and deletions.

              Nelumbo nucifera
              is an evolutionary relic from the Late Cretaceous period. Sequencing the
              N. nucifera
              mitochondrial genome is important for elucidating the evolutionary characteristics of basal eudicots. Here, the
              N. nucifera
              mitochondrial genome was sequenced using single molecule real-time sequencing technology (SMRT) and the mitochondrial genome map was constructed after
              de novo
              assembly and annotation. The results showed that the 524,797-bp
              N. nucifera
              mitochondrial genome has a total of 63 genes, including 40 protein-coding genes, three rRNA genes and 20 tRNA genes. Fifteen collinear gene clusters were conserved across different plant species. Approximately 700 RNA editing sites in the protein-coding genes were identified. Positively selected genes were identified with selection pressure analysis. Nineteen chloroplast-derived fragments were identified and seven tRNAs were derived from the chloroplast. These results suggest that the
              N. nucifera
              mitochondrial genome retains evolutionarily conserved characteristics, including ancient gene content and gene clusters, high levels of RNA editing and low levels of chloroplast-derived fragment insertions. As the first publicly available basal eudicot mitochondrial genome, the
              N. nucifera
              mitochondrial genome facilitates further analysis of the characteristics of basal eudicots and provides clues of the evolutionary trajectory from basal angiosperms to advanced eudicots.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-14-100},
	abstract = {Background: Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; E.C.4.3.1.5) is a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plant development, and it catalyses the deamination of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, leading to the production of secondary metabolites. This enzyme has been identified in many organisms, ranging from prokaryotes to higher plants. Because Nelumbo nucifera is a basal dicot rich in many secondary metabolites, it is a suitable candidate for research on the phenylpropanoid pathway.
Results: Three PAL members, NnPAL1, NnPAL2 and NnPAL3, have been identified in N. nucifera using genome-wide analysis. NnPAL1 contains two introns; however, both NnPAL2 and NnPAL3 have only one intron. Molecular and evolutionary analysis of NnPAL1 confirms that it is an ancient PAL member of the angiosperms and may have a different origin. However, PAL clusters, except NnPAL1, are monophyletic after the split between dicots and monocots. These observations suggest that duplication events remain an important occurrence in the evolution of the PAL gene family. Molecular assays demonstrate that the mRNA of the NnPAL1 gene is 2343 bp in size and encodes a 717 amino acid polypeptide. The optimal pH and temperature of the recombinant NnPAL1 protein are 9.0 and 55°C, respectively. The NnPAL1 protein retains both PAL and weak TAL catalytic activities with Km values of 1.07 mM for L-phenylalanine and 3.43 mM for L-tyrosine, respectively. Cis-elements response to environmental stress are identified and confirmed using real-time PCR for treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), ultraviolet light, Neurospora crassa (fungi) and drought.
Conclusions: We conclude that the angiosperm PAL genes are not derived from a single gene in an ancestral angiosperm genome; therefore, there may be another ancestral duplication and vertical inheritance from the gymnosperms. The different evolutionary histories for PAL genes in angiosperms suggest different mechanisms of functional regulation. The expression patterns of NnPAL1 in response to stress may be necessary for the survival of N. nucifera since the Cretaceous Period. The discovery and characterisation of the ancient NnPAL1 help to elucidate PAL evolution in angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Unilateral cross incompatibility (UCI) occurs between popcorn and dent corn, and represents a critical step towards speciation. It has been reported that
              ZmGa1P
              , encoding a pectin methylesterase (
              PME
              ), is a male determinant of the
              Ga1
              locus. However, the female determinant and the genetic relationship between male and female determinants at this locus are unclear. Here, we report three different types, a total of seven linked genes underlying the
              Ga1
              locus, which control UCI phenotype by independently affecting pollen tube growth in both antagonistic and synergistic manners. These include five pollen-expressed
              PME
              genes (
              ZmGa1Ps-m
              ), a silk-expressed PME gene (
              ZmPME3
              ), and another silk-expressed gene (
              ZmPRP3
              ), encoding a pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins.
              ZmGa1Ps-m
              confer pollen compatibility. Presence of
              ZmPME3
              causes silk to reject incompatible pollen.
              ZmPRP3
              promotes incompatibility pollen tube growth and thereby breaks the blocking effect of
              ZmPME3
              . In addition, evolutionary genomics analyses suggest that the divergence of the
              Ga1
              locus existed before maize domestication and continued during breeding improvement. The knowledge gained here deepen our understanding of the complex regulation of cross incompatibility.},

Results:  Here, we construct an approximately 6.71-Gb pan-Zea genome that contains around 4.57-Gb non-B73 reference sequences from fragmented de novo assemblies of 721 pan-Zea individuals. We annotate a total of 58,944 pan-Zea genes and find around 44.34\% of them are dispensable in the pan-Zea population. Moreover, 255,821 common structural variations are identified and genotyped in a maize association mapping panel. Further analyses reveal gene presence/absence variants and their potential roles during domestication of maize. Combining genetic analyses with multi-omics data, we demonstrate how structural variants are associated with complex agronomic traits.
Conclusions:  Our results highlight the underexplored role of the pan-Zea genome and structural variations to further understand domestication of maize and explore their potential utilization in crop improvement.},

              Missing heritability in genome-wide association studies defines a major problem in genetic analyses of complex biological traits
              1,2
              . The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions
              3,4
              . Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19 million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24\% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.},

	abstract = {Background: Meiotic recombination is a major source of genetic variation in eukaryotes. The role of recombination in evolution is recognized but little is known about how evolutionary forces affect the recombination pathway itself. Although the recombination pathway is fundamentally conserved across different species, genetic variation in recombination components and outcomes has been observed. Theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that changes in the recombination pathway are likely to provide adaptive abilities to populations experiencing directional or strong selection pressures, such as those occurring during species domestication. We hypothesized that adaptive changes in recombination may be associated with adaptive evolution patterns of genes involved in meiotic recombination.
Results: To examine how maize evolution and domestication affected meiotic recombination genes, we studied patterns of sequence polymorphism and divergence in eleven genes controlling key steps in the meiotic recombination pathway in a diverse set of maize inbred lines and several accessions of teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize. We discovered that, even though the recombination genes generally exhibited high sequence conservation expected in a pathway controlling a key cellular process, they showed substantial levels and diverse patterns of sequence polymorphism. Among others, we found differences in sequence polymorphism patterns between tropical and temperate maize germplasms. Several recombination genes displayed patterns of polymorphism indicative of adaptive evolution.
Conclusions: Despite their ancient origin and overall sequence conservation, meiotic recombination genes can exhibit extensive and complex patterns of molecular evolution. Changes in these genes could affect the functioning of the recombination pathway, and may have contributed to the successful domestication of maize and its expansion to new cultivation areas.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The emergence of noxious weeds poses a serious threat to agricultural production. Understanding their origin and evolution is therefore of major importance. Here we analyzed the intriguing case of teosinte, a wild relative of maize originating from Mexico that recently emerged as an invasive weed in maize fields in Europe. Patterns of genetic variation revealed extensive genetic introgression from maize adapted to temperate latitudes into European teosintes. Introgressed genomic regions harbored a key flowering time gene and an herbicide resistance gene. Our results exemplify how adaptive introgression can drive the evolution of a crop’s wild relative into a weed. Hybridization is an evolutionary force that should not be underestimated when forecasting invasiveness risks.
          , 
            
              Global trade has considerably accelerated biological invasions. The annual tropical teosintes, the closest wild relatives of maize, were recently reported as new agricultural weeds in two European countries, Spain and France. Their prompt settlement under climatic conditions differing drastically from that of their native range indicates rapid genetic evolution. We performed a phenotypic comparison of French and Mexican teosintes under European conditions and showed that only the former could complete their life cycle during maize cropping season. To test the hypothesis that crop-to-wild introgression triggered such rapid adaptation, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms to characterize patterns of genetic variation in French, Spanish, and Mexican teosintes as well as in maize germplasm. We showed that both Spanish and French teosintes originated from
              Zea mays
              ssp.
              mexicana
              race “Chalco,” a weedy teosinte from the Mexican highlands. However, introduced teosintes differed markedly from their Mexican source by elevated levels of genetic introgression from the high latitude Dent maize grown in Europe. We identified a clear signature of divergent selection in a region of chromosome 8 introgressed from maize and encompassing
              ZCN8
              , a major flowering time gene associated with adaptation to high latitudes. Moreover, herbicide assays and sequencing revealed that French teosintes have acquired herbicide resistance via the introgression of a mutant herbicide-target gene (
              ACC1
              ) present in herbicide-resistant maize cultivars. Altogether, our results demonstrate that adaptive crop-to-wild introgression has triggered both rapid adaptation to a new climatic niche and acquisition of herbicide resistance, thereby fostering the establishment of an emerging noxious weed.},

Although the chronology of its domestication and initial dispersals out of Mexico into Central and South America has become more clear due to molecular and multiproxy archaeobotanical research, important problems remain. Among them is the paucity of information on maize's early morphological evolution and racial diversification brought about in part by the poor preservation of macrofossils dating to the pre-5000 calibrated years before the present period from obligate dispersal routes located in the tropical forest. We report newly discovered macrobotanical and microbotanical remains of maize that shed significant light on the chronology, land race evolution, and cultural contexts associated with the crop's early movements into South America and adaptation to new environments. The evidence comes from the coastal Peruvian sites of Paredones and Huaca Prieta, Peru; dates from the middle and late preceramic and early ceramic periods (between ca. 6700 and 3000 calibrated years before the present); and constitutes some of the earliest known cobs, husks, stalks, and tassels. The macrobotanical record indicates that a diversity of racial complexes characteristic of the Andean region emerged during the preceramic era. In addition, accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon determinations carried out directly on different structures of preserved maize plants strongly suggest that assays on burned cobs are more reliable than those on unburned cobs. Our findings contribute to knowledge of the early diffusion of maize and agriculture and have broader implications for understanding the development of early preindustrial human societies.},

            Graph databases capture richly linked domain knowledge by integrating heterogeneous data and metadata into a unified representation. Here, we present the use of bespoke, interactive data graphics (bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) for visual exploration of a knowledge graph. By modeling a chart as a set of metadata that describes semantic context (SPARQL query) separately from visual context (Vega-Lite specification), we leverage the high-level, declarative nature of the SPARQL and Vega-Lite grammars to concisely specify web-based, interactive data graphics synchronized to a knowledge graph. Resources with dereferenceable URIs (uniform resource identifiers) can employ the hyperlink encoding channel or image marks in Vega-Lite to amplify the information content of a given data graphic, and published charts populate a browsable gallery of the database. We discuss design considerations that arise in relation to portability, persistence, and performance. Altogether, this pairing of SPARQL and Vega-Lite—demonstrated here in the domain of polymer nanocomposite materials science—offers an extensible approach to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) scientific data visualization within a knowledge graph framework.},

	abstract = {Background: The extent to which selection determines interspecific patterns of genetic exchange enlightens the role of adaptation in evolution and speciation. Often reported extensive interspecific introgression could be selection-driven, but also result from demographic processes, especially in cases of invasive species replacements, which can promote introgression at their invasion front. Because invasion and selective sweeps similarly mold variation, population genetics evidence for selection can only be gathered in an explicit demographic framework. The Iberian hare, Lepus granatensis, displays in its northern range extensive mitochondrial DNA introgression from L. timidus, an arctic/boreal species that it replaced locally after the last glacial maximum. We use whole-genome sequencing to infer geographic and genomic patterns of nuclear introgression and fit a neutral model of species replacement with hybridization, allowing us to evaluate how selection influenced introgression genome-wide, including for mtDNA.
Results: Although the average nuclear and mtDNA introgression patterns contrast strongly, they fit a single demographic model of post-glacial invasive replacement of timidus by granatensis. Outliers of elevated introgression include several genes related to immunity, spermatogenesis, and mitochondrial metabolism. Introgression is reduced on the X chromosome and in low recombining regions.
Conclusions: General nuclear and mtDNA patterns of introgression can be explained by purely demographic processes. Hybrid incompatibilities and interplay between selection and recombination locally modulate levels of nuclear introgression. Selection promoted introgression of some genes involved in conflicts, either interspecific (parasites) or possibly cytonuclear. In the latter case, nuclear introgression could mitigate the potential negative effects of alien mtDNA on mitochondrial metabolism and male-specific traits.},

            Robustness is a prominent feature of most biological systems. Most previous related studies have been focused on homogeneous molecular networks. Here we propose a comprehensive framework for understanding how the interactions between genes, proteins and metabolites contribute to the determinants of robustness in a heterogeneous biological network. We integrate heterogeneous sources of data to construct a multilayer interaction network composed of a gene regulatory layer, a protein–protein interaction layer, and a metabolic layer. We design a simulated perturbation process to characterize the contribution of each gene to the overall system’s robustness, and find that influential genes are enriched in essential and cancer genes. We show that the proposed mechanism predicts a higher vulnerability of the metabolic layer to perturbations applied to genes associated with metabolic diseases. Furthermore, we find that the real network is comparably or more robust than expected in multiple random realizations. Finally, we analytically derive the expected robustness of multilayer biological networks starting from the degree distributions within and between layers. These results provide insights into the non-trivial dynamics occurring in the cell after a genetic perturbation is applied, confirming the importance of including the coupling between different layers of interaction in models of complex biological systems.},

            Molecular interactions are studied as independent networks in systems biology. However, molecular networks do not exist independently of each other. In a network of networks approach (called multiplex), we study the joint organization of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. We find that TRN and PPI are non-randomly coupled across five different eukaryotic species. Gene degrees in TRN (number of downstream genes) are positively correlated with protein degrees in PPI (number of interacting protein partners). Gene–gene and protein–protein interactions in TRN and PPI, respectively, also non-randomly overlap. These design principles are conserved across the five eukaryotic species. Robustness of the TRN–PPI multiplex is dependent on this coupling. Functionally important genes and proteins, such as essential, disease-related and those interacting with pathogen proteins, are preferentially situated in important parts of the human multiplex with highly overlapping interactions. We unveil the multiplex architecture of TRN and PPI. Multiplex architecture may thus define a general framework for studying molecular networks. This approach may uncover the building blocks of the hierarchical organization of molecular interactions.},

            A palindrome in DNA is like a palindrome in language, but when read backwards, it is a complement of the forward sequence; effectively, the two halves of a sequence complement each other from its midpoint like in a double strand of DNA. Palindromes are distributed throughout the human genome and play significant roles in gene expression and regulation. Palindromic mutations are linked to many human diseases, such as neuronal disorders, mental retardation, and various cancers. In this work, we computed and analyzed the palindromic sequences in the human genome and studied their conservation in personal genomes using 1000 Genomes data. We found that {\textasciitilde}30\% of the palindromes exhibit variation, some of which are caused by rare variants. The analysis of disease/trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in palindromic regions showed that disease-associated risk variants are 14 times more likely to be present in palindromic regions than in other regions. The catalog of palindromes in the reference genome and 1000 Genomes is being made available here with details on their variations in each individual genome to serve as a resource for future and retrospective whole-genome studies identifying statistically significant palindrome variations associated with diseases or traits and their roles in disease mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Background: Genomic data production is at its highest level and continues to increase, making available novel primary data and existing public data to researchers for exploration. Here we explore the consequences of “batch” correction for biological discovery in two publicly available expression datasets. We consider this to include the estimation of and adjustment for wide-spread systematic heterogeneity in genomic measurements that is unrelated to the effects under study, whether it be technical or biological in nature.
Methods: We present three illustrative data analyses using surrogate variable analysis (SVA) and describe how to perform artifact discovery in light of natural heterogeneity within biological groups, secondary biological questions of interest, and non-linear treatment effects in a dataset profiling differentiating pluripotent cells (GSE32923) and another from human brain tissue (GSE30272).
Results: Careful specification of biological effects of interest is very important to factor-based approaches like SVA. We demonstrate greatly sharpened global and gene-specific differential expression across treatment groups in stem cell systems. Similarly, we demonstrate how to preserve major non-linear effects of age across the lifespan in the brain dataset. However, the gains in precisely defining known effects of interest come at the cost of much other information in the “cleaned” data, including sex, common copy number effects and sample or cell line-specific molecular behavior.
Conclusions: Our analyses indicate that data “cleaning” can be an important component of high-throughput genomic data analysis when interrogating explicitly defined effects in the context of data affected by robust technical artifacts. However, caution should be exercised to avoid removing biological signal of interest. It is also important to note that open data exploration is not possible after such supervised “cleaning”, because effects beyond those stipulated by the researcher may have been removed. With the goal of making these statistical algorithms more powerful and transparent to researchers in the biological sciences, we provide exploratory plots and accompanying R code for identifying and guiding “cleaning” process (https://github.com/andrewejaffe/StemCellSVA). The impact of these methods is significant enough that we have made newly processed data available for the brain data set at http://braincloud.jhmi.edu/plots/ and GSE30272.},

	abstract = {Background: Alignment-free methods of genomic comparison offer the possibility of scaling to large data sets of nucleotide sequences comprised of several thousand or more base pairs. Such methods can be used for purposes of deducing “nearby” species in a reference data set, or for constructing phylogenetic trees.
Results: We describe one such method that gives quite strong results. We use the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) to create images from such sequences, We then reduce dimension, first using a Fourier trig transform, followed by a Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). This gives vectors of modest length. These in turn are used for fast sequence lookup, construction of phylogenetic trees, and classification of virus genomic data. We illustrate the accuracy and scalability of this approach on several benchmark test sets.
Conclusions: The tandem of FCGR and dimension reductions using Fourier-type transforms and SVD provides a powerful approach for alignment-free genomic comparison. Results compare favorably and often surpass best results reported in prior literature. Good scalability is also observed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Large taxa-rich genome-scale data sets are often necessary for resolving ancient phylogenetic relationships. But accurate phylogenetic inference requires that they are analyzed with realistic models that account for the heterogeneity in substitution patterns amongst the sites, genes and lineages. Two kinds of adjustments are frequently used: models that account for heterogeneity in amino acid frequencies at sites in proteins, and partitioned models that accommodate the heterogeneity in rates (branch lengths) among different proteins in different lineages (protein-wise heterotachy). Although partitioned and site-heterogeneous models are both widely used in isolation, their relative importance to the inference of correct phylogenies has not been carefully evaluated. We conducted several empirical analyses and a large set of simulations to compare the relative performances of partitioned models, site-heterogeneous models, and combined partitioned site heterogeneous models. In general, site-homogeneous models (partitioned or not) performed worse than site heterogeneous, except in simulations with extreme protein-wise heterotachy. Furthermore, simulations using empirically-derived realistic parameter settings showed a marked long-branch attraction (LBA) problem for analyses employing protein-wise partitioning even when the generating model included partitioning. This LBA problem results from a small sample bias compounded over many single protein alignments. In some cases, this problem was ameliorated by clustering similarly-evolving proteins together into larger partitions using the PartitionFinder method. Similar results were obtained under simulations with larger numbers of taxa or heterogeneity in simulating topologies over genes. For an empirical Microsporidia test data set, all but one tested site-heterogeneous models (with or without partitioning) obtain the correct Microsporidia+Fungi grouping, whereas site-homogenous models (with or without partitioning) did not. The single exception was the fully partitioned site-heterogeneous analysis that succumbed to the compounded small sample LBA bias. In general unless protein-wise heterotachy effects are extreme, it is more important to model site-heterogeneity than protein-wise heterotachy in phylogenomic analyses. Complete protein-wise partitioning should be avoided as it can lead to a serious LBA bias. In cases of extreme protein-wise heterotachy, approaches that cluster similarly-evolving proteins together and coupled with site-heterogeneous models work well for phylogenetic estimation.},

            This is a phylogenetic network of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled from across the world. These genomes are closely related and under evolutionary selection in their human hosts, sometimes with parallel evolution events, that is, the same virus mutation emerges in two different human hosts. This makes character-based phylogenetic networks the method of choice for reconstructing their evolutionary paths and their ancestral genome in the human host. The network method has been used in around 10,000 phylogenetic studies of diverse organisms, and is mostly known for reconstructing the prehistoric population movements of humans and for ecological studies, but is less commonly employed in the field of virology.
          , 
            In a phylogenetic network analysis of 160 complete human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) genomes, we find three central variants distinguished by amino acid changes, which we have named A, B, and C, with A being the ancestral type according to the bat outgroup coronavirus. The A and C types are found in significant proportions outside East Asia, that is, in Europeans and Americans. In contrast, the B type is the most common type in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears not to have spread outside East Asia without first mutating into derived B types, pointing to founder effects or immunological or environmental resistance against this type outside Asia. The network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, indicating that phylogenetic networks can likewise be successfully used to help trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to prevent recurrent spread of the disease worldwide.},

              Triticum urartu
              , together with epigenomic profiles. Most TF binding sites (TFBSs) located distally from genes are embedded in TEs, whose functional relevance is supported by purifying selection and active epigenomic features. About 24\% of the non-TE TFBSs share significantly high sequence similarity with TE-embedded TFBSs. These non-TE TFBSs have almost no homologous sequences in non-Triticeae species and are potentially derived from Triticeae-specific TEs. The expansion of TE-derived TFBS linked to wheat-specific gene responses, suggesting TEs are an important driving force for regulatory innovations. Altogether, TEs have been significantly and continuously shaping regulatory networks related to wheat genome evolution and adaptation.},

              et al
              . cloned a gene that affects wheat plant architecture and, consequently, grain yield (see the Perspective by van Esse). Exon capture analyses identified the same gene in wild emmer wheat. The gene nonetheless remains rare among contemporary US wheat cultivars. In field trials in Jiangsu, China, overexpression of the dominant allele in transgenic wheat increased grain production by about 12\%. —PJH

	abstract = {Background: Bread wheat is one of the most important and broadly studied crops. However, due to the complexity of its genome and incomplete genome collection of wild populations, the bread wheat genome landscape and domestication history remain elusive.
Results: By investigating the whole-genome resequencing data of 93 accessions from worldwide populations of bread wheat and its diploid and tetraploid progenitors, together with 90 published exome-capture data, we find that the B subgenome has more variations than A and D subgenomes, including SNPs and deletions. Population genetics analyses support a monophyletic origin of domesticated wheat from wild emmer in northern Levant, with substantial introgressed genomic fragments from southern Levant. Southern Levant contributes more than 676 Mb in AB subgenomes and enriched in the pericentromeric regions. The AB subgenome introgression happens at the early stage of wheat speciation and partially contributes to their greater genetic diversity. Furthermore, we detect massive alien introgressions that originated from distant species through natural and artificial hybridizations, resulting in the reintroduction of {\textasciitilde} 709 Mb and {\textasciitilde} 1577 Mb sequences into bread wheat landraces and varieties, respectively. A large fraction of these intra- and inter-introgression fragments are associated with quantitative trait loci of important traits, and selection events are also identified.
Conclusion: We reveal the significance of multiple introgressions from distant wild populations and alien species in shaping the genetic components of bread wheat, and provide important resources and new perspectives for future wheat breeding.},

          , 
            
              Genomes carry millions of noncoding variants, and identifying the tiny fraction with functional consequences is a major challenge for genomics. We assessed the role of selection on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for domestication-related changes in rice grains. Among 3363 lncRNA transcripts identified in early developing panicles, 95\% of those with differential expression (329 lncRNAs) between
              Oryza sativa
              ssp.
              japonica
              and wild rice were significantly down-regulated in the domestication event. Joint genome and transcriptome analyses reveal that directional selection on lncRNAs altered the expression of energy metabolism genes during domestication. Transgenic experiments and population analyses with three focal lncRNAs illustrate that selection on these loci led to increased starch content and grain weight. Together, our findings indicate that genome-wide selection for lncRNA down-regulation was an important mechanism for the emergence of rice domestication traits.},

              Summary
              MinIONQC provides rapid diagnostic plots and quality control data from one or more flowcells of sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION instrument. It can be used to assist with the optimisation of extraction, library preparation, and sequencing protocols, to quickly and directly compare the data from many flowcells, and to provide publication-ready figures summarising sequencing data.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              MinIONQC is implemented in R and released under an MIT license. It is available for all platforms from https://github.com/roblanf/minion\_qc.},

	abstract = {Background:  Genetic variants within nearly 1000 loci are known to contribute to modulation of blood lipid levels. However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target discovery.
Results:  To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry metaanalysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovas‑cular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3–5\% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex hormones, emphasiz‑ing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism.
Conclusions:  Taken together, our findings provide insights into the biological mecha‑nisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and potentially cardiovascular disease risk.},

	abstract = {Background:  Molecular measurements of the genome, the transcriptome, and the epigenome, often termed multi-omics data, provide an in-depth view on biological systems and their integration is crucial for gaining insights in complex regulatory processes. These data can be used to explain disease related genetic variants by linking them to intermediate molecular traits (quantitative trait loci, QTL). Molecular networks regulating cellular processes leave footprints in QTL results as so-called trans-QTL hotspots. Reconstructing these networks is a complex endeavor and use of biological prior information can improve network inference. However, previous efforts were limited in the types of priors used or have only been applied to model systems. In this study, we reconstruct the regulatory networks underlying trans-QTL hotspots using human cohort data and data-driven prior information.
Methods:  We devised a new strategy to integrate QTL with human population scale multi-omics data. State-ofthe art network inference methods including BDgraph and glasso were applied to these data. Comprehensive prior information to guide network inference was manually curated from large-scale biological databases. The inference approach was extensively benchmarked using simulated data and cross-cohort replication analyses. Best performing methods were subsequently applied to real-world human cohort data.
Results:  Our benchmarks showed that prior-based strategies outperform methods without prior information in simulated data and show better replication across datasets. Application of our approach to human cohort data high‑lighted two novel regulatory networks related to schizophrenia and lean body mass for which we generated novel functional hypotheses.
Conclusions:  We demonstrate that existing biological knowledge can improve the integrative analysis of networks underlying trans associations and generate novel hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are primarily responsible for the DNA losses and gains in genome sequences that occur over time within and between species. TEs themselves evolve, with clade specific LTR/ERV, LINEs and SINEs responsible for the bulk of species-specific genomic features. Because TEs can contain regulatory motifs, they can be exapted as regulators of gene expression. While TE insertions can provide evolutionary novelty for the regulation of gene expression, their overall impact on the evolution of gene expression is unclear. Previous investigators have shown that tissue specific gene expression in amniotes is more similar across species than within species, supporting the existence of conserved developmental gene regulation. In order to understand how species-specific TE insertions might affect the evolution/conservation of gene expression, we have looked at the association of gene expression in six tissues with TE insertions in six representative amniote genomes.
Results: A novel bootstrapping approach has been used to minimise the conflation of effects of repeat types on gene expression. We compared the expression of orthologs containing recent TE insertions to orthologs that contained older TE insertions, and the expression of non-orthologs containing recent TE insertions to non-orthologs with older TE insertions. Both orthologs and non-orthologs showed significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. TEs were found associated with species-specific changes in gene expression, and the magnitude and direction of expression changes were noteworthy. Overall, orthologs containing species-specific TEs were associated with lower gene expression, while in non-orthologs, non-species specific TEs were associated with higher gene expression. Exceptions were SINE elements in human and chicken, which had an opposite association with gene expression compared to other species.
Conclusions: Our observed species-specific associations of TEs with gene expression support a role for TEs in speciation/response to selection by species. TEs do not exhibit consistent associations with gene expression and observed associations can vary depending on the age of TE insertions. Based on these observations, it would be prudent to refrain from extrapolating these and previously reported associations to distantly related species.},

              Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) is established by small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Maintenance of silencing is then based on a combination of RdDM and RNA-independent mechanisms involving DNA methyltransferase MET1 and chromodomain DNA methyltransferases (CMTs). Involvement of RdDM, according to this model should decrease with TE age but here we show a different pattern in tomato and
              Arabidopsis
              . In these species the CMTs silence long terminal repeat (LTR) transposons in the distal chromatin that are younger than those affected by RdDM. To account for these findings we propose that, after establishment of primary RdDM as in the original model, there is an RNA-independent maintenance phase involving CMTs followed by secondary RdDM. This progression of epigenetic silencing in the gene-rich distal chromatin is likely to influence the transcriptome either in
              cis
              or in
              trans
              depending on whether the mechanisms are RNA-dependent or -independent.},

            Long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing has democratized microbial genome sequencing and enables the recovery of highly contiguous microbial genomes from isolates or metagenomes. However, to obtain near-finished genomes it has been necessary to include short-read polishing to correct insertions and deletions derived from homopolymer regions. Here, we show that Oxford Nanopore R10.4 can be used to generate near-finished microbial genomes from isolates or metagenomes without short-read or reference polishing.},

              The vast phenotypic diversity of life is in part a consequence of a continual process of genetic innovation. New genes, with distinct structures and capabilities, emerge regularly throughout evolutionary history. Making use of genomics technologies, researchers are beginning to form an understanding of the details of the processes by which new genes arise. On page 797 of this issue, Cosby
              et al.
              (
              1
              ) provide clarity for one such process. Transposons are parasitic genomic elements that replicate by inserting copies of themselves in the host genome. Cosby
              et al.
              report how vertebrate genes have captured DNA transposon domains, generating new genes that encode new fusion proteins with distinct domain architectures. Fusion of transposon domains with host genes appears to be frequent, with 94 fusion events identified over tetrapod evolution. Transposon domain capture may be a common source of new genes and molecular innovation across the tree of life.},

There are a number of key morphological and physiological traits, such as disease resistance and yield that need to be maintained and improved upon if a commercial variety is to be successful. Computational tools that provide the ability to integrate and visualize this data with pedigree structure, will enable breeders to make better decisions on the lines that are used in crossings to meet both the demands for increased yield/production and adaptation to climate change.
Results: We have used a large and unique set of experimental barley (H. vulgare) data to develop a prototype pedigree visualization system. We then used this prototype to perform a subjective user evaluation with domain experts to guide and direct the development of an interactive pedigree visualization tool called Helium.
Conclusions: We show that Helium allows users to easily integrate a number of data types along with large plant pedigrees to offer an integrated environment in which they can explore pedigree data. We have also verified that users were happy with the abstract representation of pedigrees that we have used in our visualization tool.},

	abstract = {Background: LTR retrotransposons are one of the main causes for plant genome size and structure evolution, along with polyploidy. The characterization of their amplification and subsequent elimination of the genomes is therefore a major goal in plant evolutionary genomics. To address the extent and timing of these forces, we performed a detailed analysis of 41 LTR retrotransposon families in rice.
Results: Using a new method to estimate the insertion date of both truncated and complete copies, we estimated these two forces more accurately than previous studies based on other methods. We show that LTR retrotransposons have undergone bursts of amplification within the past 5 My. These bursts vary both in date and copy number among families, revealing that each family has a particular amplification history. The number of solo LTR varies among families and seems to correlate with LTR size, suggesting that solo LTR formation is a family-dependent process. The deletion rate estimate leads to the prediction that the half-life of LTR retrotransposon sequences evolving neutrally is about 19 My in rice, suggesting that other processes than the formation of small deletions are prevalent in rice DNA removal.
Conclusion: Our work provides insights into the dynamics of LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome. We show that transposable element families have distinct amplification patterns, and that the turn-over of LTR retrotransposons sequences is rapid in the rice genome.},

              investigated the origin of families of lineage-specific vertebrate genes (see the Perspective by Wacholder and Carvunis). Fusion between transposable elements (TEs) and host gene exons, once incorporated into the host genome, could generate new functional genes. Examination of

              , a bat gene that arose through this process, shows how the retention of part of the TE within this gene allows the transcribed protein to bind throughout the genome and act as a transcriptional regulator. Thus, TEs interacting within their host genome provide the raw material to generate new combinations of functional domains that can be selected upon and incorporated within the hierarchical cellular network.

              INTRODUCTION
              How novel protein architectures evolve remains poorly understood. The rearrangement of domains with preexisting functions into new composite architectures through exon shuffling is a powerful path to form genes encoding proteins with novel functionalities. Although exon shuffling is thought to account for the evolution of many protein structures, the source of new exons and splice sites as well as the mechanisms by which they become assimilated have been scarcely characterized. In this work, we investigate the contribution of DNA transposons to the formation of novel protein-coding genes through exon shuffling during vertebrate evolution.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                DNA transposons are widespread mobile elements encoding transposase proteins that promote their selfish replication in host genomes. Transposases typically contain DNA binding and catalytic nuclease domains, which may be repurposed for cellular functions. By inserting functional domains into new genomic contexts, transposase sequences can generate host-transposase fusion (HTF) genes through alternative splicing. Several genes with critical developmental functions, such the

                transcription factors, are thought to have been born through this process. However, the mechanism by which transposase domains are captured to generate HTFs, how common this process is, and the functions of most known HTF genes remain unclear.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              We used comparative genomics to survey all tetrapod genomes with available gene models (596) for putative HTFs. We identified 106 distinct HTFs derived from 94 independent fusion events over the course of {\textasciitilde}300 million years of evolution. We found that most HTFs evolved through the alternative splicing of host domains to transposase proteins using splice sites provided by the transposon. The transposase domains of all HTFs analyzed (81) are evolving under purifying selection, which suggests that they have been maintained for organismal function. The domain composition of HTF proteins indicates that most of them consist of transposase DNA binding domains fused to host domains that are predicted to function in transcriptional and/or chromatin regulation, especially the repressive Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain (involved in {\textasciitilde}30\% of all HTFs), which suggests that many HTFs function as transcriptional regulators. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that four independently evolved KRAB-transposase fusion proteins repress gene expression in a sequence-specific manner in reporter assays. Furthermore, loss of function, rescue, and regulatory genomics experiments in bat cells revealed that the bat-specific KRABINER fusion protein binds hundreds of cognate transposons genome-wide and controls a large network of genes and cis-regulatory elements.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our findings confirm that exon shuffling is a major evolutionary force generating genetic novelty. We provide evidence that DNA transposons promote exon shuffling by inserting transposase domains in new genomic contexts. This process provides a plausible path for the emergence of several ancient transcription factors with important developmental functions. By illustrating how a transcription factor and its dispersed binding sites can emerge simultaneously from a single transposon family, our results bolster the view that transposons are key players in the evolution of gene regulatory networks.

            Genes with novel cellular functions may evolve through exon shuffling, which can assemble novel protein architectures. Here, we show that DNA transposons provide a recurrent supply of materials to assemble protein-coding genes through exon shuffling. We find that transposase domains have been captured—primarily via alternative splicing—to form fusion proteins at least 94 times independently over the course of {\textasciitilde}350 million years of tetrapod evolution. We find an excess of transposase DNA binding domains fused to host regulatory domains, especially the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, and identify four independently evolved KRAB-transposase fusion proteins repressing gene expression in a sequence-specific fashion. The bat-specific KRABINER fusion protein binds its cognate transposons genome-wide and controls a network of genes and cis-regulatory elements. These results illustrate how a transcription factor and its binding sites can emerge.},
